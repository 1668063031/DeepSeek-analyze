A split at an index i where 0 <= i <= n - 2 is called valid if the product of the first i + 1 elements and the product of the remaining elements are coprime.

For example, if nums = [2, 3, 3], then a split at the index i = 0 is valid because 2 and 9 are coprime, while a split at the index i = 1 is not valid because 6 and 3 are not coprime. A split at the index i = 2 is not valid because i == n - 1.

Return the smallest index i at which the array can be split validly or -1 if there is no such split.
Two values val1 and val2 are coprime if gcd(val1, val2) == 1 where gcd(val1, val2) is the greatest common divisor of val1 and val2.

Initially all elements of the array are unmarked.
You need to apply m queries on the array in order, where on the ith query you do the following:

Mark the element at index indexi if it is not already marked.
Then mark ki unmarked elements in the array with the smallest values. If multiple such elements exist, mark the ones with the smallest indices. And if less than ki unmarked elements exist, then mark all of them.

Example 1:

Explanation:
We do the following queries on the array:

Mark the element at index 1, and 2 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices if they exist, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 8.
Mark the element at index 3, since it is already marked we skip it. Then we mark 3 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 3.
Mark the element at index 4, since it is already marked we skip it. Then we mark 2 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices if they exist, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 0.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,3], queries = [[0,1]]
Output: [7]

```","Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string ""aabccc"" we replace ""aa"" by ""a2"" and replace ""ccc"" by ""c3"". Thus the compressed string becomes ""a2bc3"".
Notice that in this problem, we are not adding '1' after single characters.
Given a string s and an integer k. You need to delete at most k characters from s such that the run-length encoded version of s has minimum length.
Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded version of s after deleting at most k characters.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.
Example 2:

Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be ""a4"" of length 2.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""aaaaaaaaaaa"", k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: Since k is zero, we cannot delete anything. The compressed string is ""a11"" of length 3.

```","You are given a 1-indexed array of integers nums of length n.
We define a function greaterCount such that greaterCount(arr, val) returns the number of elements in arr that are strictly greater than val.
You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:

If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) > greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to arr1.
If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) < greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to arr2.
If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) == greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to the array with a lesser number of elements.
If there is still a tie, append nums[i] to arr1.

The array result is formed by concatenating the arrays arr1 and arr2. For example, if arr1 == [1,2,3] and arr2 == [4,5,6], then result = [1,2,3,4,5,6].
Return the integer array result.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,3]
Output: [2,3,1,3]
Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [2] and arr2 = [1].
In the 3rd operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. Also, the lengths are equal, hence, append nums[3] to arr1.
In the 4th operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. As the length of arr2 is lesser, hence, append nums[4] to arr2.
After 4 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1,3].
Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1,3].

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,14,3,1,2]
Output: [5,3,1,2,14]
Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [5] and arr2 = [14].
In the 3rd operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is one in both arrays. Also, the lengths are equal, hence, append nums[3] to arr1.
In the 4th operation, the number of elements greater than 1 is greater in arr1 than arr2 (2 > 1). Hence, append nums[4] to arr1.
In the 5th operation, the number of elements greater than 2 is greater in arr1 than arr2 (2 > 1). Hence, append nums[5] to arr1.
After 5 operations, arr1 = [5,3,1,2] and arr2 = [14].
Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [5,3,1,2,14].

Example 3:

```","Given a string s of lowercase letters, you need to find the maximum number of non-empty substrings of s that meet the following conditions:

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.
Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""adefaddaccc""
Output: [""e"",""f"",""ccc""]
Explanation: The following are all the possible substrings that meet the conditions:
[
  ""adefaddaccc""
  ""adefadda"",
  ""ef"",
  ""e"",
  ""f"",
  ""ccc"",
]
If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbaccd""
Output: [""d"",""bb"",""cc""]
Explanation: Notice that while the set of substrings [""d"",""abba"",""cc""] also has length 3, it's considered incorrect since it has larger total length.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s contains only lowercase English letters.

```","You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, each of length n, and a 1-indexed 2D array queries where queries[i] = [xi, yi].
For the ith query, find the maximum value of nums1[j] + nums2[j] among all indices j (0 <= j < n), where nums1[j] >= xi and nums2[j] >= yi, or -1 if there is no j satisfying the constraints.
Return an array answer where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [4,3,1,2], nums2 = [2,4,9,5], queries = [[4,1],[1,3],[2,5]]
Output: [6,10,7]
Explanation: 
For the 1st query xi = 4 and yi = 1, we can select index j = 0 since nums1[j] >= 4 and nums2[j] >= 1. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 6, and we can show that 6 is the maximum we can obtain.

For the 2nd query xi = 1 and yi = 3, we can select index j = 2 since nums1[j] >= 1 and nums2[j] >= 3. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 10, and we can show that 10 is the maximum we can obtain. 

For the 3rd query xi = 2 and yi = 5, we can select index j = 3 since nums1[j] >= 2 and nums2[j] >= 5. The sum nums1[j] + nums2[j] is 7, and we can show that 7 is the maximum we can obtain.

Therefore, we return [6,10,7].

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [3,2,5], nums2 = [2,3,4], queries = [[4,4],[3,2],[1,1]]
Output: [9,9,9]
Explanation: For this example, we can use index j = 2 for all the queries since it satisfies the constraints for each query.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [2,1], nums2 = [2,3], queries = [[3,3]]
Output: [-1]
Explanation: There is one query in this example with xi = 3 and yi = 3. For every index, j, either nums1[j] < xi or nums2[j] < yi. Hence, there is no solution. 

 
Constraints:

nums1.length == nums2.length

Your task is to select the longest alternating subsequence from words. A subsequence of words is alternating if for any two consecutive strings in the sequence, their corresponding elements in the binary array groups differ. Essentially, you are to choose strings such that adjacent elements have non-matching corresponding bits in the groups array.
Formally, you need to find the longest subsequence of an array of indices [0, 1, ..., n - 1] denoted as [i0, i1, ..., ik-1], such that groups[ij] != groups[ij+1] for each 0 <= j < k - 1 and then find the words corresponding to these indices.

Note: The elements in words are distinct.
 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""e"",""a"",""b""], groups = [0,0,1]
Output: [""e"",""b""]
Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [""e"",""b""] because groups[0] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is [""a"",""b""] because groups[1] != groups[2]. It can be demonstrated that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 2.

Example 2:

Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d""], groups = [1,0,1,1]
Output: [""a"",""b"",""c""]
Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [""a"",""b"",""c""] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is [""a"",""b"",""d""] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[3].

```","You are given a string word containing lowercase English letters.
Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with [""a"",""b"",""c""], we need to push the key one time to type ""a"", two times to type ""b"", and three times to type ""c"" .
It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.
Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.
An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, *, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.

 
Example 1:


Input: word = ""abcde""
Output: 5
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
""a"" -> one push on key 2
""b"" -> one push on key 3
""c"" -> one push on key 4
""d"" -> one push on key 5
""e"" -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

Example 2:


Input: word = ""xyzxyzxyzxyz""
Output: 12
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
""x"" -> one push on key 2
""y"" -> one push on key 3
""z"" -> one push on key 4
Total cost is 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
Note that the key 9 is not mapped to any letter: it is not necessary to map letters to every key, but to map all the letters.

Example 3:


Input: word = ""aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii""
Output: 24
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
""a"" -> one push on key 2
""b"" -> one push on key 3
""c"" -> one push on key 4
""d"" -> one push on key 5
""e"" -> one push on key 6
""f"" -> one push on key 7
""g"" -> one push on key 8
""h"" -> two pushes on key 9
""i"" -> one push on key 9
Total cost is 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 24.

Given an array positions where positions[i] = [xi, yi] is the position of the ith customer on the map, return the minimum sum of the euclidean distances to all customers.
In other words, you need to choose the position of the service center [xcentre, ycentre] such that the following formula is minimized:

Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted.
 
Example 1:


Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 4.00000
Explanation: As shown, you can see that choosing [xcentre, ycentre] = [1, 1] will make the distance to each customer = 1, the sum of all distances is 4 which is the minimum possible we can achieve.

Example 2:


Input: positions = [[1,1],[3,3]]

In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
	
For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].
In the second hiring session, we will choose 1st worker because they have the same lowest cost as 4th worker but they have the smallest index [3,2,7,7,2]. Please note that the indexing may be changed in the process.

- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.
- In the third hiring round there are less than three candidates. We choose the worker from the remaining workers [2,4]. The lowest cost is 2 (index 0). The total cost = 2 + 2 = 4.

```","You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes in an undirected graph. The nodes are labeled from 1 to n.
You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes ai and bi. Notice that the given graph may be disconnected.
Divide the nodes of the graph into m groups (1-indexed) such that:

Each node in the graph belongs to exactly one group.
For every pair of nodes in the graph that are connected by an edge [ai, bi], if ai belongs to the group with index x, and bi belongs to the group with index y, then |y - x| = 1.

Return the maximum number of groups (i.e., maximum m) into which you can divide the nodes. Return -1 if it is impossible to group the nodes with the given conditions.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 6, edges = [[1,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,3],[4,6]]
Output: 4
Explanation: As shown in the image we:
- Add node 5 to the first group.
- Add node 1 to the second group.
- Add nodes 2 and 4 to the third group.
- Add nodes 3 and 6 to the fourth group.
We can see that every edge is satisfied.
It can be shown that that if we create a fifth group and move any node from the third or fourth group to it, at least on of the edges will not be satisfied.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: -1
Explanation: If we add node 1 to the first group, node 2 to the second group, and node 3 to the third group to satisfy the first two edges, we can see that the third edge will not be satisfied.
It can be shown that no grouping is possible.

1 <= n <= 500
1 <= edges.length <= 104

1 <= ai, bi <= n
ai != bi

To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.



Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.
 
Example 1:

Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]

Explanation:
One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.

Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.

Example 2:

Explanation:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds.

```","You are given two integers m and n representing the dimensions of a 0-indexed m x n grid.
You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix coordinates, where coordinates[i] = [x, y] indicates that the cell with coordinates [x, y] is colored black. All cells in the grid that do not appear in coordinates are white.
A block is defined as a 2 x 2 submatrix of the grid. More formally, a block with cell [x, y] as its top-left corner where 0 <= x < m - 1 and 0 <= y < n - 1 contains the coordinates [x, y], [x + 1, y], [x, y + 1], and [x + 1, y + 1].
Return a 0-indexed integer array arr of size 5 such that arr[i] is the number of blocks that contains exactly i black cells.
 
Example 1:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, coordinates = [[0,0]]
Output: [3,1,0,0,0]
Explanation: The grid looks like this:

There is only 1 block with one black cell, and it is the block starting with cell [0,0].
The other 3 blocks start with cells [0,1], [1,0] and [1,1]. They all have zero black cells. 
Thus, we return [3,1,0,0,0]. 

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 3, coordinates = [[0,0],[1,1],[0,2]]
Output: [0,2,2,0,0]
Explanation: The grid looks like this:

There are 2 blocks with two black cells (the ones starting with cell coordinates [0,0] and [0,1]).
The other 2 blocks have starting cell coordinates of [1,0] and [1,1]. They both have 1 black cell.
Therefore, we return [0,2,2,0,0].

 
Constraints:

2 <= m <= 105
2 <= n <= 105
0 <= coordinates.length <= 104
coordinates[i].length == 2
0 <= coordinates[i][0] < m
0 <= coordinates[i][1] < n
It is guaranteed that coordinates contains pairwise distinct coordinates.

```","You are given a 2D integer array ranges where ranges[i] = [starti, endi] denotes that all integers between starti and endi (both inclusive) are contained in the ith range.
You are to split ranges into two (possibly empty) groups such that:

Each range belongs to exactly one group.
Any two overlapping ranges must belong to the same group.

Two ranges are said to be overlapping if there exists at least one integer that is present in both ranges.

For example, [1, 3] and [2, 5] are overlapping because 2 and 3 occur in both ranges.

Return the total number of ways to split ranges into two groups. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: ranges = [[6,10],[5,15]]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The two ranges are overlapping, so they must be in the same group.
Thus, there are two possible ways:
- Put both the ranges together in group 1.
- Put both the ranges together in group 2.

Example 2:

Input: ranges = [[1,3],[10,20],[2,5],[4,8]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
Ranges [1,3], and [2,5] are overlapping. So, they must be in the same group.
Again, ranges [2,5] and [4,8] are also overlapping. So, they must also be in the same group. 
Thus, there are four possible ways to group them:
- All the ranges in group 1.
- All the ranges in group 2.
- Ranges [1,3], [2,5], and [4,8] in group 1 and [10,20] in group 2.

In the 4th operation, as the last element of arr2 is greater than the last element of arr1 (4 > 3), append nums[4] to arr2, hence arr2 becomes [4,8].
After 4 operations, arr1 = [5,3] and arr2 = [4,8].
Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [5,3,4,8].

 
Constraints:

3 <= n <= 50
1 <= nums[i] <= 100
All elements in nums are distinct.

```","You are given an integer n representing the size of a 0-indexed memory array. All memory units are initially free.
You have a memory allocator with the following functionalities:

Allocate a block of size consecutive free memory units and assign it the id mID.
Free all memory units with the given id mID.

Note that:

Multiple blocks can be allocated to the same mID.
You should free all the memory units with mID, even if they were allocated in different blocks.

Implement the Allocator class:

Allocator(int n) Initializes an Allocator object with a memory array of size n.
int allocate(int size, int mID) Find the leftmost block of size consecutive free memory units and allocate it with the id mID. Return the block's first index. If such a block does not exist, return -1.
int freeMemory(int mID) Free all memory units with the id mID. Return the number of memory units you have freed.

 
Example 1:

Input

```","Some robots are standing on an infinite number line with their initial coordinates given by a 0-indexed integer array nums and will start moving once given the command to move. The robots will move a unit distance each second.
You are given a string s denoting the direction in which robots will move on command. 'L' means the robot will move towards the left side or negative side of the number line, whereas 'R' means the robot will move towards the right side or positive side of the number line.
If two robots collide, they will start moving in opposite directions.
Return the sum of distances between all the pairs of robots d seconds after the command. Since the sum can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note: 

For two robots at the index i and j, pair (i,j) and pair (j,i) are considered the same pair.
When robots collide, they instantly change their directions without wasting any time.
Collision happens when two robots share the same place in a moment.
	
For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 2 going to the left, the next second they'll be both in 1 and they will change direction and the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 2, heading right.
For example, if a robot is positioned in 0 going to the right and another is positioned in 1 going to the left, the next second the first one will be in 0, heading left, and another will be in 1, heading right.



 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-2,0,2], s = ""RLL"", d = 3
Output: 8
Explanation: 
After 1 second, the positions are [-1,-1,1]. Now, the robot at index 0 will move left, and the robot at index 1 will move right.
After 2 seconds, the positions are [-2,0,0]. Now, the robot at index 1 will move left, and the robot at index 2 will move right.
After 3 seconds, the positions are [-3,-1,1].
The distance between the robot at index 0 and 1 is abs(-3 - (-1)) = 2.
The distance between the robot at index 0 and 2 is abs(-3 - 1) = 4.
The distance between the robot at index 1 and 2 is abs(-1 - 1) = 2.
The sum of the pairs of all distances = 2 + 4 + 2 = 8.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0], s = ""RL"", d = 2

Explanation: 
After 1 second, the positions are [2,-1].
After 2 seconds, the positions are [3,-2].

Return an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose beauty is the maximum among all k-subsequences. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
Notes

f(c) is the number of times a character c occurs in s, not a k-subsequence.
Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""bcca"", k = 2

Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 1, and f('c') = 2.
The k-subsequences of s are: 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('a') = 2 
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3 
There are 4 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 3. 
Hence, the answer is 4. 

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbcd"", k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 2, f('c') = 1, and f('d') = 1.

abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5 
There are 2 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 5. 
Hence, the answer is 2.

The rules of the game are as follows:
1st friend receives the ball.

After that, 1st friend passes it to the friend who is k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 2 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 3 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction, and so on and so forth.

In other words, on the ith turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it to the friend who is i * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.

```","Alice had a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers. She chose an arbitrary positive integer k and created two new 0-indexed integer arrays lower and higher in the following manner:

lower[i] = arr[i] - k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n
higher[i] = arr[i] + k, for every index i where 0 <= i < n

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.
Given an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.
Note: The test cases are generated such that there exists at least one valid array arr.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,10,6,4,8,12]
Output: [3,7,11]
Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.
Another valid possibility is that arr = [5,7,9] and k = 3. In that case, lower = [2,4,6] and higher = [8,10,12]. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,3,3]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
If arr = [2,2] and k = 1, we get lower = [1,1] and higher = [3,3].
Combining lower and higher gives us [1,1,3,3], which is equal to nums.
Note that arr cannot be [1,3] because in that case, the only possible way to obtain [1,1,3,3] is with k = 0.
This is invalid since k must be positive.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [5,435]
Output: [220]
Explanation:
The only possible combination is arr = [220] and k = 215. Using them, we get lower = [5] and higher = [435].

Example 1:

Explanation: For the first query the substring in range [0,2] is ""101"" which has a decimal value of 5, and 5 ^ 0 = 5, hence the answer to the first query is [0,2]. In the second query, the substring in range [2,3] is ""11"", and has a decimal value of 3, and 3 ^ 1 = 2. So, [2,3] is returned for the second query. 


Example 2:

Input: s = ""0101"", queries = [[12,8]]
Output: [[-1,-1]]
Explanation: In this example there is no substring that answers the query, hence [-1,-1] is returned.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""1"", queries = [[4,5]]
Output: [[0,0]]
Explanation: For this example, the substring in range [0,0] has a decimal value of 1, and 1 ^ 4 = 5. So, the answer is [0,0].

```","A concert hall has n rows numbered from 0 to n - 1, each with m seats, numbered from 0 to m - 1. You need to design a ticketing system that can allocate seats in the following cases:

If a group of k spectators can sit together in a row.
If every member of a group of k spectators can get a seat. They may or may not sit together.

Note that the spectators are very picky. Hence:

They will book seats only if each member of their group can get a seat with row number less than or equal to maxRow. maxRow can vary from group to group.
In case there are multiple rows to choose from, the row with the smallest number is chosen. If there are multiple seats to choose in the same row, the seat with the smallest number is chosen.

Implement the BookMyShow class:

BookMyShow(int n, int m) Initializes the object with n as number of rows and m as number of seats per row.
int[] gather(int k, int maxRow) Returns an array of length 2 denoting the row and seat number (respectively) of the first seat being allocated to the k members of the group, who must sit together. In other words, it returns the smallest possible r and c such that all [c, c + k - 1] seats are valid and empty in row r, and r <= maxRow. Returns [] in case it is not possible to allocate seats to the group.
boolean scatter(int k, int maxRow) Returns true if all k members of the group can be allocated seats in rows 0 to maxRow, who may or may not sit together. If the seats can be allocated, it allocates k seats to the group with the smallest row numbers, and the smallest possible seat numbers in each row. Otherwise, returns false.

```","An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:

Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.
Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.

For example, one way to encode an original string ""abcdefghijklmnop"" might be:

Split it as a sequence: [""ab"", ""cdefghijklmn"", ""o"", ""p""].
Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes [""ab"", ""12"", ""1"", ""p""].
Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: ""ab121p"".

Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.
Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.
 
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""internationalization"", s2 = ""i18n""
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that ""internationalization"" was the original string.
- ""internationalization"" 
  -> Split:       [""internationalization""]
  -> Do not replace any element
  -> Concatenate:  ""internationalization"", which is s1.
- ""internationalization""
  -> Split:       [""i"", ""nternationalizatio"", ""n""]
  -> Replace:     [""i"", ""18"",                 ""n""]
  -> Concatenate:  ""i18n"", which is s2

Example 2:

Input: s1 = ""l123e"", s2 = ""44""
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that ""leetcode"" was the original string.
- ""leetcode"" 
  -> Split:      [""l"", ""e"", ""et"", ""cod"", ""e""]
  -> Replace:    [""l"", ""1"", ""2"",  ""3"",   ""e""]
  -> Concatenate: ""l123e"", which is s1.
- ""leetcode"" 
  -> Split:      [""leet"", ""code""]
  -> Replace:    [""4"",    ""4""]
  -> Concatenate: ""44"", which is s2.

Example 3:

Input: s1 = ""a5b"", s2 = ""c5b""
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible.
- The original string encoded as s1 must start with the letter 'a'.
- The original string encoded as s2 must start with the letter 'c'.

```","A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with n vertices where each vertex is labeled from 1 to n (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.
Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every change minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.
The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.

For example the second minimum value of [2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2, 4] is 4.

Given n, edges, time, and change, return the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.
Notes:

You can go through any vertex any number of times, including 1 and n.
You can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned green.

 
Example 1:
        

Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[3,4],[4,5]], time = 3, change = 5
Output: 13
Explanation:
The figure on the left shows the given graph.
The blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path.
The time taken is:
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.

The red path shows the path to get the second minimum time.
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
- Wait at 4 for 4 minutes, time elapsed=10
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13
Hence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.      

Example 2:


Input: n = 2, edges = [[1,2]], time = 3, change = 2
Output: 11
Explanation:
The minimum time path is 1 -> 2 with time = 3 minutes.
The second minimum time path is 1 -> 2 -> 1 -> 2 with time = 11 minutes.
 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 104
n - 1 <= edges.length <= min(2 * 104, n * (n - 1) / 2)

1 <= ui, vi <= n
ui != vi
There are no duplicate edges.
Each vertex can be reached directly or indirectly from every other vertex.

As the train conductor, you would like to get rid of all the cars containing illegal goods. You can do any of the following three operations any number of times:

Remove a train car from the left end (i.e., remove s[0]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from the right end (i.e., remove s[s.length - 1]) which takes 1 unit of time.
Remove a train car from anywhere in the sequence which takes 2 units of time.

- remove a car from the left end 2 times. Time taken is 2 * 1 = 2.
- remove a car from the right end. Time taken is 1.
- remove the car containing illegal goods found in the middle. Time taken is 2.

```","You are given an array of equal-length strings words. Assume that the length of each string is n.
Each string words[i] can be converted into a difference integer array difference[i] of length n - 1 where difference[i][j] = words[i][j+1] - words[i][j] where 0 <= j <= n - 2. Note that the difference between two letters is the difference between their positions in the alphabet i.e. the position of 'a' is 0, 'b' is 1, and 'z' is 25.

For example, for the string ""acb"", the difference integer array is [2 - 0, 1 - 2] = [2, -1].

All the strings in words have the same difference integer array, except one. You should find that string.
Return the string in words that has different difference integer array.
 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""adc"",""wzy"",""abc""]
Output: ""abc""
Explanation: 
- The difference integer array of ""adc"" is [3 - 0, 2 - 3] = [3, -1].
- The difference integer array of ""wzy"" is [25 - 22, 24 - 25]= [3, -1].
- The difference integer array of ""abc"" is [1 - 0, 2 - 1] = [1, 1]. 
The odd array out is [1, 1], so we return the corresponding string, ""abc"".

Example 2:

Input: words = [""aaa"",""bob"",""ccc"",""ddd""]

Output: 2
Explanation: If we remove the 2 edges [1,1,2] and [1,1,3]. The graph will still be fully traversable by Alice and Bob. Removing any additional edge will not make it so. So the maximum number of edges we can remove is 2.

Example 2:

```","A company is organizing a meeting and has a list of n employees, waiting to be invited. They have arranged for a large circular table, capable of seating any number of employees.
The employees are numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each employee has a favorite person and they will attend the meeting only if they can sit next to their favorite person at the table. The favorite person of an employee is not themself.
Given a 0-indexed integer array favorite, where favorite[i] denotes the favorite person of the ith employee, return the maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting.
 
Example 1:


Input: favorite = [2,2,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation:
The above figure shows how the company can invite employees 0, 1, and 2, and seat them at the round table.
All employees cannot be invited because employee 2 cannot sit beside employees 0, 1, and 3, simultaneously.
Note that the company can also invite employees 1, 2, and 3, and give them their desired seats.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3. 

Example 2:

Input: favorite = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
Each employee is the favorite person of at least one other employee, and the only way the company can invite them is if they invite every employee.
The seating arrangement will be the same as that in the figure given in example 1:
- Employee 0 will sit between employees 2 and 1.
- Employee 1 will sit between employees 0 and 2.
- Employee 2 will sit between employees 1 and 0.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 3.

Output: 4
Explanation:
The above figure shows how the company will invite employees 0, 1, 3, and 4, and seat them at the round table.
Employee 2 cannot be invited because the two spots next to their favorite employee 1 are taken.
So the company leaves them out of the meeting.
The maximum number of employees that can be invited to the meeting is 4.

The score of si is the length of the longest common prefix between si and sn (Note that s == sn).
Given the final string s, return the sum of the score of every si.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""babab""
Output: 9
Explanation:
For s1 == ""b"", the longest common prefix is ""b"" which has a score of 1.
For s2 == ""ab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s3 == ""bab"", the longest common prefix is ""bab"" which has a score of 3.
For s4 == ""abab"", there is no common prefix so the score is 0.
For s5 == ""babab"", the longest common prefix is ""babab"" which has a score of 5.
The sum of the scores is 1 + 0 + 3 + 0 + 5 = 9, so we return 9.

For s2 == ""az"", the longest common prefix is ""az"" which has a score of 2.
For s6 == ""azbzaz"", the longest common prefix is ""azb"" which has a score of 3.
For s9 == ""azbazbzaz"", the longest common prefix is ""azbazbzaz"" which has a score of 9.

Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

1 <= arr.length <= 105

Return the minimum number of operations to make nums a semi-ordered permutation.
A permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length n containing each number exactly once.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,4,3]

There are n stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, while the number of stones is more than one, they will do the following:

Choose an integer x > 1, and remove the leftmost x stones from the row.
Add the sum of the removed stones' values to the player's score.
Place a new stone, whose value is equal to that sum, on the left side of the row.

The game stops when only one stone is left in the row.

Explanation:
- Alice removes the first 4 stones, adds (-1) + 2 + (-3) + 4 = 2 to her score, and places a stone of
  value 2 on the left. stones = [2,-5].
- Bob removes the first 2 stones, adds 2 + (-5) = -3 to his score, and places a stone of value -3 on

Return an array of strings containing the new strings formed after the splits, excluding empty strings.
Notes

separator is used to determine where the split should occur, but it is not included as part of the resulting strings.
A split may result in more than two strings.
The resulting strings must maintain the same order as they were initially given.

 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""one.two.three"",""four.five"",""six""], separator = "".""
Output: [""one"",""two"",""three"",""four"",""five"",""six""]
Explanation: In this example we split as follows:

""one.two.three"" splits into ""one"", ""two"", ""three""
""four.five"" splits into ""four"", ""five""
""six"" splits into ""six"" 

Hence, the resulting array is [""one"",""two"",""three"",""four"",""five"",""six""].
Example 2:

Input: words = [""$easy$"",""$problem$""], separator = ""$""
Output: [""easy"",""problem""]
Explanation: In this example we split as follows: 

""$easy$"" splits into ""easy"" (excluding empty strings)
""$problem$"" splits into ""problem"" (excluding empty strings)

Hence, the resulting array is [""easy"",""problem""].

Example 3:

The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].

For i = 0: Select the 2 largest values from nums2 at indices [1, 2, 4] where nums1[j] < nums1[0], resulting in 50 + 30 = 80.
For i = 1: Select the 2 largest values from nums2 at index [2] where nums1[j] < nums1[1], resulting in 30.
For i = 2: No indices satisfy nums1[j] < nums1[2], resulting in 0.
For i = 3: Select the 2 largest values from nums2 at indices [0, 1, 2, 4] where nums1[j] < nums1[3], resulting in 50 + 30 = 80.
For i = 4: Select the 2 largest values from nums2 at indices [1, 2] where nums1[j] < nums1[4], resulting in 30 + 20 = 50.


Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,2,2,2], nums2 = [3,1,2,3], k = 1
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation:
Since all elements in nums1 are equal, no indices satisfy the condition nums1[j] < nums1[i] for any i, resulting in 0 for all positions.

There could be at most 8 paths from the cells namely: east, south-east, south, south-west, west, north-west, north, and north-east.
Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.
Note that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are 1, 9, 1, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: 1, 19, 191.

Return the most frequent prime number greater than 10 out of all the numbers created by traversing the matrix or -1 if no such prime number exists. If there are multiple prime numbers with the highest frequency, then return the largest among them.
Note: It is invalid to change the direction during the move.
 
Example 1:
 


Input: mat = [[1,1],[9,9],[1,1]]
Output: 19
Explanation: 
From cell (0,0) there are 3 possible directions and the numbers greater than 10 which can be created in those directions are:
East: [11], South-East: [19], South: [19,191].
Numbers greater than 10 created from the cell (0,1) in all possible directions are: [19,191,19,11].

```","You have n packages that you are trying to place in boxes, one package in each box. There are m suppliers that each produce boxes of different sizes (with infinite supply). A package can be placed in a box if the size of the package is less than or equal to the size of the box.
The package sizes are given as an integer array packages, where packages[i] is the size of the ith package. The suppliers are given as a 2D integer array boxes, where boxes[j] is an array of box sizes that the jth supplier produces.
You want to choose a single supplier and use boxes from them such that the total wasted space is minimized. For each package in a box, we define the space wasted to be size of the box - size of the package. The total wasted space is the sum of the space wasted in all the boxes.

For example, if you have to fit packages with sizes [2,3,5] and the supplier offers boxes of sizes [4,8], you can fit the packages of size-2 and size-3 into two boxes of size-4 and the package with size-5 into a box of size-8. This would result in a waste of (4-2) + (4-3) + (8-5) = 6.

Return the minimum total wasted space by choosing the box supplier optimally, or -1 if it is impossible to fit all the packages inside boxes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[4,8],[2,8]]
Output: 6
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the first supplier, using two size-4 boxes and one size-8 box.

Example 2:

Input: packages = [2,3,5], boxes = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,4]]

Example 3:

Input: packages = [3,5,8,10,11,12], boxes = [[12],[11,9],[10,5,14]]
Output: 9
Explanation: It is optimal to choose the third supplier, using two size-5 boxes, two size-10 boxes, and two size-14 boxes.
The total waste is (5-3) + (5-5) + (10-8) + (10-10) + (14-11) + (14-12) = 9.

Input: s = ""7+3*1*2"", answers = [20,13,42]
Output: 7
Explanation: As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,13,42]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [20,13,42]
The points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""3+5*2"", answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
Output: 19
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
The points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""6+0*1"", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 6.
If a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.
By the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.
The points for the students are: [0,0,5,0,0,5]. The sum of the points is 10.

```","There exist n rectangles in a 2D plane with edges parallel to the x and y axis. You are given two 2D integer arrays bottomLeft and topRight where bottomLeft[i] = [a_i, b_i] and topRight[i] = [c_i, d_i] represent the bottom-left and top-right coordinates of the ith rectangle, respectively.
You need to find the maximum area of a square that can fit inside the intersecting region of at least two rectangles. Return 0 if such a square does not exist.
 
Example 1:

Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[6,6]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 1. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.
Example 2:

Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[1,3],[1,5]], topRight = [[5,5],[5,7],[5,9]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
A square with side length 2 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 2 * 2 = 4. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.
Example 3:
  
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[3,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside the intersecting region of any two rectangles. Also, no larger square can, so the maximum area is 1. Note that the region can be formed by the intersection of more than 2 rectangles.
Example 4:
  
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[3,3],[3,1]], topRight = [[2,2],[4,4],[4,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation:
No pair of rectangles intersect, hence, the answer is 0.

- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 and 1 with a sum equal to 8 + 1 == 9.
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 and 0 with a sum equal to 10 + 0 == 10.
Hence, the punishment number of 10 is 1 + 81 + 100 = 182

Example 2:

Input: n = 37
Output: 1478
Explanation: There are exactly 4 integers i in the range [1, 37] that satisfy the conditions in the statement:
- 1 since 1 * 1 = 1. 
- 9 since 9 * 9 = 81 and 81 can be partitioned into 8 + 1. 
- 10 since 10 * 10 = 100 and 100 can be partitioned into 10 + 0. 
- 36 since 36 * 36 = 1296 and 1296 can be partitioned into 1 + 29 + 6.
Hence, the punishment number of 37 is 1 + 81 + 100 + 1296 = 1478

```","You are given a binary array possible of length n.
Alice and Bob are playing a game that consists of n levels. Some of the levels in the game are impossible to clear while others can always be cleared. In particular, if possible[i] == 0, then the ith level is impossible to clear for both the players. A player gains 1 point on clearing a level and loses 1 point if the player fails to clear it.
At the start of the game, Alice will play some levels in the given order starting from the 0th level, after which Bob will play for the rest of the levels.
Alice wants to know the minimum number of levels she should play to gain more points than Bob, if both players play optimally to maximize their points.
Return the minimum number of levels Alice should play to gain more points. If this is not possible, return -1.
Note that each player must play at least 1 level.
 
Example 1:

Input: possible = [1,0,1,0]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Let's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:

If Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has -1 + 1 - 1 = -1 point.
If Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 = 0 points, while Bob has 1 - 1 = 0 points.
If Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 - 1 + 1 = 1 point, while Bob has -1 point.

Alice must play a minimum of 1 level to gain more points.

Example 2:

Input: possible = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
Let's look at all the levels that Alice can play up to:

If Alice plays only level 0 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 1 point, while Bob has 4 points.
If Alice plays till level 1 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 2 points, while Bob has 3 points.
If Alice plays till level 2 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 3 points, while Bob has 2 points.
If Alice plays till level 3 and Bob plays the rest of the levels, Alice has 4 points, while Bob has 1 point.

Alice must play a minimum of 3 levels to gain more points.

Example 3:

Input: possible = [0,0]
Output: -1
Explanation:
The only possible way is for both players to play 1 level each. Alice plays level 0 and loses 1 point. Bob plays level 1 and loses 1 point. As both players have equal points, Alice can't gain more points than Bob.

```","You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of equal length n and a positive integer k. You must choose a subsequence of indices from nums1 of length k.
For chosen indices i0, i1, ..., ik - 1, your score is defined as:

The sum of the selected elements from nums1 multiplied with the minimum of the selected elements from nums2.
It can defined simply as: (nums1[i0] + nums1[i1] +...+ nums1[ik - 1]) * min(nums2[i0] , nums2[i1], ... ,nums2[ik - 1]).

A subsequence of indices of an array is a set that can be derived from the set {0, 1, ..., n-1} by deleting some or no elements.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,3,3,2], nums2 = [2,1,3,4], k = 3
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The four possible subsequence scores are:
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 2 with score = (1+3+3) * min(2,1,3) = 7.
- We choose the indices 0, 1, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,1,4) = 6. 
- We choose the indices 0, 2, and 3 with score = (1+3+2) * min(2,3,4) = 12. 
- We choose the indices 1, 2, and 3 with score = (3+3+2) * min(1,3,4) = 8.
Therefore, we return the max score, which is 12.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,2,3,1,1], nums2 = [7,5,10,9,6], k = 1
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Choosing index 2 is optimal: nums1[2] * nums2[2] = 3 * 10 = 30 is the maximum possible score.

Notes

A cycle is a series of nodes a1, a2, ..., an, an+1 such that node a1 is the same node as node an+1, the nodes a1, a2, ..., an are distinct, and there is a directed edge from the node ai to node ai+1 for every i in the range [1, n].
A DAG is a directed graph that does not have any cycle.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Team 1 is weaker than team 0. Team 2 is weaker than team 1. So the champion is team 0.

Example 2:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,2]]

- All the pairs (0,1), (0,2), (1,3), (1,4) and (2,5) result in one character which is always a palindrome.
- The pair (2,3) result in the string ""aca"" which is a palindrome.
- The pair (1,5) result in the string ""cac"" which is a palindrome.
- The pair (3,5) result in the string ""acac"" which can be rearranged into the palindrome ""acca"".

Example 2:

For example, after one second, a[0] remains the same, a[1] becomes a[0] + a[1], a[2] becomes a[0] + a[1] + a[2], and so on.
Return the value of a[n - 1] after k seconds.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Return the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types, given that you can perform as many operations as you would like.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [20,1,15], x = 5
Output: 13
Explanation: Initially, the chocolate types are [0,1,2]. We will buy the 1st type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the types of chocolates will become [1,2,0]. We will buy the 2nd type of chocolate at a cost of 1.
Now, we will again perform the operation at a cost of 5, and the chocolate types will become [2,0,1]. We will buy the 0th type of chocolate at a cost of 1.

In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] into trees[1].
Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].

In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].

The resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.
Example 2:


Input: trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]
Output: []
Explanation:
Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0].
Delete trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]].

The resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.

Example 3:


Input: trees = [[5,4],[3]]

Do nothing.

Return an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0].
Second 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,2,0].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0].
Second 4: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0].
Second 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 7: Do nothing.
Second 8: Mark the index changeIndices[8], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.

Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,2].
Second 2: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,1].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,0].
Second 4: Mark the index changeIndices[4], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 5: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,0].
Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.
Hence, the answer is 6.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,1], changeIndices = [2,2,2]

```","You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums.
A subarray of nums is called incremovable if nums becomes strictly increasing on removing the subarray. For example, the subarray [3, 4] is an incremovable subarray of [5, 3, 4, 6, 7] because removing this subarray changes the array [5, 3, 4, 6, 7] to [5, 6, 7] which is strictly increasing.
Return the total number of incremovable subarrays of nums.
Note that an empty array is considered strictly increasing.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: The 10 incremovable subarrays are: [1], [2], [3], [4], [1,2], [2,3], [3,4], [1,2,3], [2,3,4], and [1,2,3,4], because on removing any one of these subarrays nums becomes strictly increasing. Note that you cannot select an empty subarray.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,5,7,8]
Output: 7
Explanation: The 7 incremovable subarrays are: [5], [6], [5,7], [6,5], [5,7,8], [6,5,7] and [6,5,7,8].
It can be shown that there are only 7 incremovable subarrays in nums.

Example 3:

Output: 3
Explanation: The 3 incremovable subarrays are: [8,7,6], [7,6,6], and [8,7,6,6]. Note that [8,7] is not an incremovable subarray because after removing [8,7] nums becomes [6,6], which is sorted in ascending order but not strictly increasing.

Example 1:

- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]

Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.

```","You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums containing positive integers.
Your task is to minimize the length of nums by performing the following operations any number of times (including zero):

Select two distinct indices i and j from nums, such that nums[i] > 0 and nums[j] > 0.
Insert the result of nums[i] % nums[j] at the end of nums.
Delete the elements at indices i and j from nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,4,3,1]
Output: 1
Explanation: One way to minimize the length of the array is as follows:
Operation 1: Select indices 2 and 1, insert nums[2] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [1,4,3,1,3], then delete elements at indices 2 and 1.
nums becomes [1,1,3].
Operation 2: Select indices 1 and 2, insert nums[1] % nums[2] at the end and it becomes [1,1,3,1], then delete elements at indices 1 and 2.
nums becomes [1,1].
Operation 3: Select indices 1 and 0, insert nums[1] % nums[0] at the end and it becomes [1,1,0], then delete elements at indices 1 and 0.
nums becomes [0].
The length of nums cannot be reduced further. Hence, the answer is 1.
It can be shown that 1 is the minimum achievable length.

Operation 2: Select indices 2 and 3, insert nums[2] % nums[3] at the end and it becomes [5,5,5,5,0], then delete elements at indices 2 and 3. 
nums becomes [5,5,0]. 
Operation 3: Select indices 0 and 1, insert nums[0] % nums[1] at the end and it becomes [5,5,0,0], then delete elements at indices 0 and 1.

Explanation:
The valid arrangements of pieces on the board are:

Let n be the length of nums. If n == 1, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array newNums of length n / 2.
For every even index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
For every odd index i where 0 <= i < n / 2, assign the value of newNums[i] as max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]).
Replace the array nums with newNums.
Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.

Return the last number that remains in nums after applying the algorithm.
 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,3,5,2,4,8,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: The following arrays are the results of applying the algorithm repeatedly.
First: nums = [1,5,4,2]
Second: nums = [1,4]
Third: nums = [1]
1 is the last remaining number, so we return 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3]
Output: 3
Explanation: 3 is already the last remaining number, so we return 3.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1024
1 <= nums[i] <= 109

Your task is to create groups using numbers from 0 to n - 1, ensuring that each number, i, is used no more than usageLimits[i] times in total across all groups. You must also satisfy the following conditions:

Each group must consist of distinct numbers, meaning that no duplicate numbers are allowed within a single group.
Each group (except the first one) must have a length strictly greater than the previous group.

```","A farmer has a rectangular grid of land with m rows and n columns that can be divided into unit cells. Each cell is either fertile (represented by a 1) or barren (represented by a 0). All cells outside the grid are considered barren.
A pyramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with the following criteria:

The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
The apex of a pyramid is the topmost cell of the pyramid. The height of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r <= i <= r + h - 1 and c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r).

An inverse pyramidal plot of land can be defined as a set of cells with similar criteria:

The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
The apex of an inverse pyramid is the bottommost cell of the inverse pyramid. The height of an inverse pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r - h + 1 <= i <= r and c - (r - i) <= j <= c + (r - i).

Some examples of valid and invalid pyramidal (and inverse pyramidal) plots are shown below. Black cells indicate fertile cells.

Example 1:


Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The 2 possible pyramidal plots are shown in blue and red respectively.
There are no inverse pyramidal plots in this grid. 
Hence total number of pyramidal and inverse pyramidal plots is 2 + 0 = 2.

Example 2:


Input: grid = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The pyramidal plot is shown in blue, and the inverse pyramidal plot is shown in red. 
Hence the total number of plots is 1 + 1 = 2.

Example 3:


Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,1]]
Output: 13
Explanation: There are 7 pyramidal plots, 3 of which are shown in the 2nd and 3rd figures.

a 2D integer array colConditions of size m where colConditions[i] = [lefti, righti].

The two arrays contain integers from 1 to k.
You have to build a k x k matrix that contains each of the numbers from 1 to k exactly once. The remaining cells should have the value 0.
The matrix should also satisfy the following conditions:

The number abovei should appear in a row that is strictly above the row at which the number belowi appears for all i from 0 to n - 1.
The number lefti should appear in a column that is strictly left of the column at which the number righti appears for all i from 0 to m - 1.

Example 1:


Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[3,2]], colConditions = [[2,1],[3,2]]
Output: [[3,0,0],[0,0,1],[0,2,0]]
Explanation: The diagram above shows a valid example of a matrix that satisfies all the conditions.
The row conditions are the following:
- Number 1 is in row 1, and number 2 is in row 2, so 1 is above 2 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.
The column conditions are the following:
- Number 2 is in column 1, and number 1 is in column 2, so 2 is left of 1 in the matrix.
- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.
Note that there may be multiple correct answers.

Example 2:

Input: k = 3, rowConditions = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1],[2,3]], colConditions = [[2,1]]
Output: []
Explanation: From the first two conditions, 3 has to be below 1 but the third conditions needs 3 to be above 1 to be satisfied.
No matrix can satisfy all the conditions, so we return the empty matrix.

The length of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.

More formally, if the frog is at stones[i] and is jumping to stones[j], the length of the jump is |stones[i] - stones[j]|.

Explanation: The above figure represents one of the optimal paths the frog can take.

Note: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], modulo = 2, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example the interesting subarrays are: 
The subarray nums[0..0] which is [3]. 
- There is only one index, i = 0, in the range [0, 0] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 1 and cnt % modulo == k.  
The subarray nums[0..1] which is [3,2].
- There is only one index, i = 0, in the range [0, 1] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k.  
- Hence, cnt = 1 and cnt % modulo == k.
The subarray nums[0..2] which is [3,2,4]. 
- There is only one index, i = 0, in the range [0, 2] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 1 and cnt % modulo == k. 
It can be shown that there are no other interesting subarrays. So, the answer is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,9,6], modulo = 3, k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example the interesting subarrays are: 
The subarray nums[0..3] which is [3,1,9,6]. 
- There are three indices, i = 0, 2, 3, in the range [0, 3] that satisfy nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 3 and cnt % modulo == k. 
The subarray nums[1..1] which is [1]. 
- There is no index, i, in the range [1, 1] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 0 and cnt % modulo == k. 
It can be shown that there are no other interesting subarrays. So, the answer is 2.

```","Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win, or ""Tie"" if they will end the game with the same score.
 
Example 1:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
Output: ""Bob""
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.

Example 2:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

Example 3:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,6]
Output: ""Tie""
Explanation: Alice cannot win this game. She can end the game in a draw if she decided to choose all the first three piles, otherwise she will lose.

Input: grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]
Explanation:

The diagonals with a black arrow (bottom-left triangle) should be sorted in non-increasing order:

[1, 8, 6] becomes [8, 6, 1].
[9, 5] and [4] remain unchanged.

The diagonals with a blue arrow (top-right triangle) should be sorted in non-decreasing order:

[7, 2] becomes [2, 7].
[3] remains unchanged.


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,2]]
Output: [[2,1],[1,0]]
Explanation:

The diagonals with a black arrow must be non-increasing, so [0, 2] is changed to [2, 0]. The other diagonals are already in the correct order.

Example 3:

Input: grid = [[1]]
Output: [[1]]
Explanation:
Diagonals with exactly one element are already in order, so no changes are needed.

 
Constraints:

grid.length == grid[i].length == n
1 <= n <= 10
-105 <= grid[i][j] <= 105

```","You are the owner of a company that creates alloys using various types of metals. There are n different types of metals available, and you have access to k machines that can be used to create alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy.
For the ith machine to create an alloy, it needs composition[i][j] units of metal of type j. Initially, you have stock[i] units of metal type i, and purchasing one unit of metal type i costs cost[i] coins.
Given integers n, k, budget, a 1-indexed 2D array composition, and 1-indexed arrays stock and cost, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of budget coins.
All alloys must be created with the same machine.
Return the maximum number of alloys that the company can create.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 2, budget = 15, composition = [[1,1,1],[1,1,10]], stock = [0,0,0], cost = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: It is optimal to use the 1st machine to create alloys.
To create 2 alloys we need to buy the:
- 2 units of metal of the 1st type.
- 2 units of metal of the 2nd type.
- 2 units of metal of the 3rd type.
In total, we need 2 * 1 + 2 * 2 + 2 * 3 = 12 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 15.
Notice that we have 0 units of metal of each type and we have to buy all the required units of metal.
It can be proven that we can create at most 2 alloys.

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, k = 2, budget = 15, composition = [[1,1,1],[1,1,10]], stock = [0,0,100], cost = [1,2,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: It is optimal to use the 2nd machine to create alloys.
To create 5 alloys we need to buy:
- 5 units of metal of the 1st type.
- 5 units of metal of the 2nd type.
- 0 units of metal of the 3rd type.
In total, we need 5 * 1 + 5 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 15 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 15.
It can be proven that we can create at most 5 alloys.

Example 3:

Input: n = 2, k = 3, budget = 10, composition = [[2,1],[1,2],[1,1]], stock = [1,1], cost = [5,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: It is optimal to use the 3rd machine to create alloys.
To create 2 alloys we need to buy the:
- 1 unit of metal of the 1st type.
- 1 unit of metal of the 2nd type.

```","There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.
You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.
All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.
If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.
Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.
Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.
Note: The positions may be unsorted.
 
 
Example 1:


Input: positions = [5,4,3,2,1], healths = [2,17,9,15,10], directions = ""RRRRR""
Output: [2,17,9,15,10]
Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].

Example 2:


Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = ""RLRL""
Output: [14]
Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

Example 3:


Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = ""RLRL""
Output: []
Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].
 
Constraints:

1 <= positions.length == healths.length == directions.length == n <= 105

You are also given an integer array queries of size m. For the ith query, you want to make all of the elements of nums equal to queries[i]. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

Increase or decrease an element of the array by 1.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to queries[i].
Note that after each query the array is reset to its original state.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,6,8], queries = [1,5]
Output: [14,10]
Explanation: For the first query we can do the following operations:
- Decrease nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [1,1,6,8].
- Decrease nums[2] 5 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,8].
- Decrease nums[3] 7 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,1].
So the total number of operations for the first query is 2 + 5 + 7 = 14.
For the second query we can do the following operations:
- Increase nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [5,1,6,8].
- Increase nums[1] 4 times, so that nums = [5,5,6,8].
- Decrease nums[2] 1 time, so that nums = [5,5,5,8].
- Decrease nums[3] 3 times, so that nums = [5,5,5,5].
So the total number of operations for the second query is 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 10.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,9,6,3], queries = [10]
Output: [20]
Explanation: We can increase each value in the array to 10. The total number of operations will be 8 + 1 + 4 + 7 = 20.

Explanation: In this example, we apply the following operations:
- Choose index 1, replace it with 4 (from range [4,8]), nums = [4,4,1,2].
- Choose index 3, replace it with 4 (from range [0,4]), nums = [4,4,1,4].
After the applied operations, the beauty of the array nums is 3 (subsequence consisting of indices 0, 1, and 3).

```","You are given an integer n indicating there are n people numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are also given a 0-indexed 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei] indicates that person xi and person yi have a meeting at timei. A person may attend multiple meetings at the same time. Finally, you are given an integer firstPerson.
Person 0 has a secret and initially shares the secret with a person firstPerson at time 0. This secret is then shared every time a meeting takes place with a person that has the secret. More formally, for every meeting, if a person xi has the secret at timei, then they will share the secret with person yi, and vice versa.
The secrets are shared instantaneously. That is, a person may receive the secret and share it with people in other meetings within the same time frame.
Return a list of all the people that have the secret after all the meetings have taken place. You may return the answer in any order.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 6, meetings = [[1,2,5],[2,3,8],[1,5,10]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,5]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 5, person 1 shares the secret with person 2.
At time 8, person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 10, person 1 shares the secret with person 5.​​​​
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 5 know the secret after all the meetings.

Example 2:

Input: n = 4, meetings = [[3,1,3],[1,2,2],[0,3,3]], firstPerson = 3
Output: [0,1,3]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 3.
At time 2, neither person 1 nor person 2 know the secret.
At time 3, person 3 shares the secret with person 0 and person 1.
Thus, people 0, 1, and 3 know the secret after all the meetings.

Example 3:

Input: n = 5, meetings = [[3,4,2],[1,2,1],[2,3,1]], firstPerson = 1
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation:
At time 0, person 0 shares the secret with person 1.
At time 1, person 1 shares the secret with person 2, and person 2 shares the secret with person 3.
Note that person 2 can share the secret at the same time as receiving it.
At time 2, person 3 shares the secret with person 4.
Thus, people 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 know the secret after all the meetings.

When i = 0, nums[0] == nums[2] and nums[0] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[0] = |0 - 2| + |0 - 3| = 5. 
When i = 1, arr[1] = 0 because there is no other index with value 3.
When i = 2, nums[2] == nums[0] and nums[2] == nums[3]. Therefore, arr[2] = |2 - 0| + |2 - 3| = 3. 
When i = 3, nums[3] == nums[0] and nums[3] == nums[2]. Therefore, arr[3] = |3 - 0| + |3 - 2| = 4. 
When i = 4, arr[4] = 0 because there is no other index with value 2. 


Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,5,3]

In other words, let Bij be the bitwise OR of the subarray nums[i...j]. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at i, such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to max(Bik) where i <= k <= n - 1.

The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.
Return an integer array answer of size n where answer[i] is the length of the minimum sized subarray starting at i with maximum bitwise OR.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,2,1,3]
Output: [3,3,2,2,1]
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise OR starting at any index is 3. 
- Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields it is [1,0,2].
- Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [0,2,1].
- Starting at index 2, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [2,1].
- Starting at index 3, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [1,3].
- Starting at index 4, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [3].
Therefore, we return [3,3,2,2,1]. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation:
Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is of length 2.
Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is of length 1.
Therefore, we return [2,1].

You have been cursed in such a way that after absorbing energy from magician i, you will be instantly transported to magician (i + k). This process will be repeated until you reach the magician where (i + k) does not exist.
In other words, you will choose a starting point and then teleport with k jumps until you reach the end of the magicians' sequence, absorbing all the energy during the journey.

```","You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2, of equal length n.
In one operation, you can swap the values of any two indices of nums1. The cost of this operation is the sum of the indices.
Find the minimum total cost of performing the given operation any number of times such that nums1[i] != nums2[i] for all 0 <= i <= n - 1 after performing all the operations.
Return the minimum total cost such that nums1 and nums2 satisfy the above condition. In case it is not possible, return -1.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 0 and 3, incurring cost = 0 + 3 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,2,3,1,5]
- Swap values at indices 1 and 2, incurring cost = 1 + 2 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,3,2,1,5].
- Swap values at indices 0 and 4, incurring cost = 0 + 4 = 4. Now, nums1 =[5,3,2,1,4].
We can see that for each index i, nums1[i] != nums2[i]. The cost required here is 10.
Note that there are other ways to swap values, but it can be proven that it is not possible to obtain a cost less than 10.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,2,2,1,3], nums2 = [1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 2 and 3, incurring cost = 2 + 3 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,2,1,2,3].
- Swap values at indices 1 and 4, incurring cost = 1 + 4 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,3,1,2,2].
The total cost needed here is 10, which is the minimum possible.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2], nums2 = [1,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
It can be shown that it is not possible to satisfy the given conditions irrespective of the number of operations we perform.
Hence, we return -1.

```","Given an array nums that represents a permutation of integers from 1 to n. We are going to construct a binary search tree (BST) by inserting the elements of nums in order into an initially empty BST. Find the number of different ways to reorder nums so that the constructed BST is identical to that formed from the original array nums.

For example, given nums = [2,1,3], we will have 2 as the root, 1 as a left child, and 3 as a right child. The array [2,3,1] also yields the same BST but [3,2,1] yields a different BST.

Return the number of ways to reorder nums such that the BST formed is identical to the original BST formed from nums.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can reorder nums to be [2,3,1] which will yield the same BST. There are no other ways to reorder nums which will yield the same BST.

Example 2:


Input: nums = [3,4,5,1,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The following 5 arrays will yield the same BST: 
[3,1,2,4,5]
[3,1,4,2,5]
[3,1,4,5,2]
[3,4,1,2,5]
[3,4,1,5,2]

Output: 0
Explanation: There are no other orderings of nums that will yield the same BST.

Winston was given the above mysterious function func. He has an integer array arr and an integer target and he wants to find the values l and r that make the value |func(arr, l, r) - target| minimum possible.
Return the minimum possible value of |func(arr, l, r) - target|.
Notice that func should be called with the values l and r where 0 <= l, r < arr.length.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [9,12,3,7,15], target = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Calling func with all the pairs of [l,r] = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[0,2],[1,3],[2,4],[0,3],[1,4],[0,4]], Winston got the following results [9,12,3,7,15,8,0,3,7,0,0,3,0,0,0]. The value closest to 5 is 7 and 3, thus the minimum difference is 2.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [1000000,1000000,1000000], target = 1
Output: 999999
Explanation: Winston called the func with all possible values of [l,r] and he always got 1000000, thus the min difference is 999999.

```","There is a rooted tree consisting of n nodes numbered 0 to n - 1. Each node's number denotes its unique genetic value (i.e. the genetic value of node x is x). The genetic difference between two genetic values is defined as the bitwise-XOR of their values. You are given the integer array parents, where parents[i] is the parent for node i. If node x is the root of the tree, then parents[x] == -1.
You are also given the array queries where queries[i] = [nodei, vali]. For each query i, find the maximum genetic difference between vali and pi, where pi is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between nodei and the root (including nodei and the root). More formally, you want to maximize vali XOR pi.
Return an array ans where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.
 
Example 1:


Input: parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]
Output: [2,3,7]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- [0,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 2 XOR 0 = 2.
- [3,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 2 XOR 1 = 3.
- [2,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.

Example 2:


Input: parents = [3,7,-1,2,0,7,0,2], queries = [[4,6],[1,15],[0,5]]
Output: [6,14,7]
Explanation: The queries are processed as follows:
- [4,6]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 6 XOR 0 = 6.
- [1,15]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 15 XOR 1 = 14.
- [0,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.

Answers within 10-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.
Note: Squares may overlap. Overlapping areas should be counted only once in this version.
 
Example 1:

Input: squares = [[0,0,1],[2,2,1]]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation:

Any horizontal line between y = 1 and y = 2 results in an equal split, with 1 square unit above and 1 square unit below. The minimum y-value is 1.

Example 2:

Input: squares = [[0,0,2],[1,1,1]]

Explanation:

Since the blue square overlaps with the red square, it will not be counted again. Thus, the line y = 1 splits the squares into two equal parts.

```","You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisting of non-negative powers of 2, and an integer target.
In one operation, you must apply the following changes to the array:

Choose any element of the array nums[i] such that nums[i] > 1.
Remove nums[i] from the array.
Add two occurrences of nums[i] / 2 to the end of nums.

Return the minimum number of operations you need to perform so that nums contains a subsequence whose elements sum to target. If it is impossible to obtain such a subsequence, return -1.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,8], target = 7
Output: 1
Explanation: In the first operation, we choose element nums[2]. The array becomes equal to nums = [1,2,4,4].
At this stage, nums contains the subsequence [1,2,4] which sums up to 7.
It can be shown that there is no shorter sequence of operations that results in a subsequnce that sums up to 7.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,32,1,2], target = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: In the first operation, we choose element nums[1]. The array becomes equal to nums = [1,1,2,16,16].
In the second operation, we choose element nums[3]. The array becomes equal to nums = [1,1,2,16,8,8]
At this stage, nums contains the subsequence [1,1,2,8] which sums up to 12.
It can be shown that there is no shorter sequence of operations that results in a subsequence that sums up to 12.
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,32,1], target = 35
Output: -1
Explanation: It can be shown that no sequence of operations results in a subsequence that sums up to 35.

Return the minimum number of operations to make an array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
 
Example 1:

Output: 2
Explanation: Here are the steps to sort the array in non-decreasing order:
- From [3,9,3], replace the 9 with 3 and 6 so the array becomes [3,3,6,3]
- From [3,3,6,3], replace the 6 with 3 and 3 so the array becomes [3,3,3,3,3]

Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3
Output: 4788
Explanation: To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following operations: 
- Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19.
- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score becomes 19 * 18 = 342.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 2, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multipy the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 342 * 14 = 4788.
It can be proven that 4788 is the highest score one can obtain.

A polygon is a closed plane figure that has at least 3 sides. The longest side of a polygon is smaller than the sum of its other sides.
Conversely, if you have k (k >= 3) positive real numbers a1, a2, a3, ..., ak where a1 <= a2 <= a3 <= ... <= ak and a1 + a2 + a3 + ... + ak-1 > ak, then there always exists a polygon with k sides whose lengths are a1, a2, a3, ..., ak.
The perimeter of a polygon is the sum of lengths of its sides.
Return the largest possible perimeter of a polygon whose sides can be formed from nums, or -1 if it is not possible to create a polygon.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,5,5]
Output: 15
Explanation: The only possible polygon that can be made from nums has 3 sides: 5, 5, and 5. The perimeter is 5 + 5 + 5 = 15.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,12,1,2,5,50,3]

Explanation: The polygon with the largest perimeter which can be made from nums has 5 sides: 1, 1, 2, 3, and 5. The perimeter is 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 12.
We cannot have a polygon with either 12 or 50 as the longest side because it is not possible to include 2 or more smaller sides that have a greater sum than either of them.
It can be shown that the largest possible perimeter is 12.

Example 3:

- Then the second pile is chosen and 8 gifts are left behind.
- After that the first pile is chosen and 5 gifts are left behind.

You are given the integer n and an array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between vertices ui and vi with a weight of wi.
A walk on a graph is a sequence of vertices and edges. The walk starts and ends with a vertex, and each edge connects the vertex that comes before it and the vertex that comes after it. It's important to note that a walk may visit the same edge or vertex more than once.
The cost of a walk starting at node u and ending at node v is defined as the bitwise AND of the weights of the edges traversed during the walk. In other words, if the sequence of edge weights encountered during the walk is w0, w1, w2, ..., wk, then the cost is calculated as w0 & w1 & w2 & ... & wk, where & denotes the bitwise AND operator.

In the second query, there is no walk between nodes 3 and 4, so the answer is -1.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. On the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

Example 2:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].
You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.

For example, if expression = ""1|1|(0&0)&1"", its value is 1|1|(0&0)&1 = 1|1|0&1 = 1|0&1 = 1&1 = 1. We want to apply operations so that the new expression evaluates to 0.

Turn a '1' into a '0'.
Turn a '0' into a '1'.
Turn a '&' into a '|'.

Each element in nums represents an ID, and the corresponding element in freq indicates how many times that ID should be added to or removed from the collection at each step.

Addition of IDs: If freq[i] is positive, it means freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are added to the collection at step i.
Removal of IDs: If freq[i] is negative, it means -freq[i] IDs with the value nums[i] are removed from the collection at step i.

After step 1, we have 3 IDs with the value of 2 and 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[1] = 3.
After step 2, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3. So ans[2] = 2.
After step 3, we have 2 IDs with the value of 3 and 1 ID with the value of 1. So ans[3] = 2.

Example 2:

Explanation:
After step 0, we have 2 IDs with the value of 5. So ans[0] = 2.

You are given an integer array nums representing how much money is stashed in each house. More formally, the ith house from the left has nums[i] dollars.
You are also given an integer k, representing the minimum number of houses the robber will steal from. It is always possible to steal at least k houses.
Return the minimum capability of the robber out of all the possible ways to steal at least k houses.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.
- Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.
Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,7,9,3,1], k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 7 ways to rob the houses. The way which leads to minimum capability is to rob the house at index 0 and 4. Return max(nums[0], nums[4]) = 2.

 
Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
1 <= nums[i] <= 109

At each step, if you are at city i, you can pick any city j such that j != i and 0 <= j < locations.length and move to city j. Moving from city i to city j reduces the amount of fuel you have by |locations[i] - locations[j]|. Please notice that |x| denotes the absolute value of x.

Example 2:

Input: locations = [4,3,1], start = 1, finish = 0, fuel = 6

Example 3:

Input: locations = [5,2,1], start = 0, finish = 2, fuel = 3

The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts.

Example 1:


Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]

```","A parentheses string is a non-empty string consisting only of '(' and ')'. It is valid if any of the following conditions is true:

It is ().
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid parentheses strings.
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid parentheses string.

You are given an m x n matrix of parentheses grid. A valid parentheses string path in the grid is a path satisfying all of the following conditions:

The path starts from the upper left cell (0, 0).
The path ends at the bottom-right cell (m - 1, n - 1).
The path only ever moves down or right.
The resulting parentheses string formed by the path is valid.

Return true if there exists a valid parentheses string path in the grid. Otherwise, return false.
 
Example 1:


Input: grid = [[""("",""("",""(""],["")"",""("","")""],[""("",""("","")""],[""("",""("","")""]]
Output: true
Explanation: The above diagram shows two possible paths that form valid parentheses strings.
The first path shown results in the valid parentheses string ""()(())"".
The second path shown results in the valid parentheses string ""((()))"".
Note that there may be other valid parentheses string paths.

Example 2:


Input: grid = [["")"","")""],[""("",""(""]]
Output: false
Explanation: The two possible paths form the parentheses strings ""))("" and "")(("". Since neither of them are valid parentheses strings, we return false.

1st index: 9 is the first, and 6 is the second integer greater than 4, to the right of 4.

```","Due to a bug, there are many duplicate folders in a file system. You are given a 2D array paths, where paths[i] is an array representing an absolute path to the ith folder in the file system.

For example, [""one"", ""two"", ""three""] represents the path ""/one/two/three"".

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.

For example, folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:

	
/a
/a/x
/a/x/y
/a/z
/b
/b/x
/b/x/y
/b/z


However, if the file structure also included the path ""/b/w"", then the folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" would not be identical. Note that ""/a/x"" and ""/b/x"" would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Once all the identical folders and their subfolders have been marked, the file system will delete all of them. The file system only runs the deletion once, so any folders that become identical after the initial deletion are not deleted.
Return the 2D array ans containing the paths of the remaining folders after deleting all the marked folders. The paths may be returned in any order.
 
Example 1:


Input: paths = [[""a""],[""c""],[""d""],[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""b""],[""d"",""a""]]
Output: [[""d""],[""d"",""a""]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown.
Folders ""/a"" and ""/c"" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty
folder named ""b"".

Example 2:


Input: paths = [[""a""],[""c""],[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""b""],[""a"",""b"",""x""],[""a"",""b"",""x"",""y""],[""w""],[""w"",""y""]]
Output: [[""c""],[""c"",""b""],[""a""],[""a"",""b""]]
Explanation: The file structure is as shown. 
Folders ""/a/b/x"" and ""/w"" (and their subfolders) are marked for deletion because they both contain an empty folder named ""y"".
Note that folders ""/a"" and ""/c"" are identical after the deletion, but they are not deleted because they were not marked beforehand.

Example 3:


Input: paths = [[""a"",""b""],[""c"",""d""],[""c""],[""a""]]
Output: [[""c""],[""c"",""d""],[""a""],[""a"",""b""]]
Explanation: All folders are unique in the file system.
Note that the returned array can be in a different order as the order does not matter.

 
Constraints:

1 <= paths.length <= 2 * 104
1 <= paths[i].length <= 500
1 <= paths[i][j].length <= 10

path[i][j] consists of lowercase English letters.
No two paths lead to the same folder.

Choose any element of the array and flip a bit in its binary representation. Flipping a bit means changing a 0 to 1 or vice versa.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the bitwise XOR of all elements of the final array equal to k.
Note that you can flip leading zero bits in the binary representation of elements. For example, for the number (101)2 you can flip the fourth bit and obtain (1101)2.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,4], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose element 2 which is 3 == (011)2, we flip the first bit and we obtain (010)2 == 2. nums becomes [2,1,2,4].
- Choose element 0 which is 2 == (010)2, we flip the third bit and we obtain (110)2 = 6. nums becomes [6,1,2,4].
The XOR of elements of the final array is (6 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 4) == 1 == k.
It can be shown that we cannot make the XOR equal to k in less than 2 operations.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,0,2,0], k = 0

```","You are given an array target that consists of distinct integers and another integer array arr that can have duplicates.
In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in arr. For example, if arr = [1,4,1,2], you can add 3 in the middle and make it [1,4,3,1,2]. Note that you can insert the integer at the very beginning or end of the array.
Return the minimum number of operations needed to make target a subsequence of arr.
A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order. For example, [2,7,4] is a subsequence of [4,2,3,7,2,1,4] (the underlined elements), while [2,4,2] is not.
 
Example 1:

Input: target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: You can add 5 and 1 in such a way that makes arr = [5,9,4,1,2,3,4], then target will be a subsequence of arr.

Example 2:

Input: target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], arr = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1]

```","There is an undirected connected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and n - 1 edges.
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n where nums[i] represents the value of the ith node. You are also given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.


For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = 6, 1 ^ 9 = 8, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.

Return the minimum score of any possible pair of edge removals on the given tree.
 
Example 1:


Input: nums = [1,5,5,4,11], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]]
Output: 9
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [1,3,4] with values [5,4,11]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 4 ^ 11 = 10.
- The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.

Example 2:


Input: nums = [5,5,2,4,4,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[5,2],[4,3],[1,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: The diagram above shows a way to make a pair of removals.
- The 1st component has nodes [3,4] with values [4,4]. Its XOR value is 4 ^ 4 = 0.
- The 2nd component has nodes [1,0] with values [5,5]. Its XOR value is 5 ^ 5 = 0.
- The 3rd component has nodes [2,5] with values [2,2]. Its XOR value is 2 ^ 2 = 0.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 0 - 0 = 0.
We cannot obtain a smaller score than 0.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [-3,-1,1,3,5]
Explanation: For index i = 0, there is 1 element in the prefix and 4 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[0] = 1 - 4 = -3.
For index i = 1, there are 2 distinct elements in the prefix and 3 distinct elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[1] = 2 - 3 = -1.

For index i = 3, there are 4 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 4 - 1 = 3.
For index i = 4, there are 5 distinct elements in the prefix and no elements in the suffix. Thus, diff[4] = 5 - 0 = 5.

For index i = 3, there are 3 distinct elements in the prefix and 1 distinct element in the suffix. Thus, diff[3] = 3 - 1 = 2.

Let prefix be the array containing the prefix sums of nums after rearranging it. In other words, prefix[i] is the sum of the elements from 0 to i in nums after rearranging it. The score of nums is the number of positive integers in the array prefix.
Return the maximum score you can achieve.
 
Example 1:

Alice wants Bob to find the root of the tree. She allows Bob to make several guesses about her tree. In one guess, he does the following:

Chooses two distinct integers u and v such that there exists an edge [u, v] in the tree.
He tells Alice that u is the parent of v in the tree.

```","There exists an undirected and initially unrooted tree with n nodes indexed from 0 to n - 1. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
Each node has an associated price. You are given an integer array price, where price[i] is the price of the ith node.
The price sum of a given path is the sum of the prices of all nodes lying on that path.
The tree can be rooted at any node root of your choice. The incurred cost after choosing root is the difference between the maximum and minimum price sum amongst all paths starting at root.
Return the maximum possible cost amongst all possible root choices.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4],[3,5]], price = [9,8,7,6,10,5]
Output: 24
Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 2. The first part (colored in red) shows the path with the maximum price sum. The second part (colored in blue) shows the path with the minimum price sum.
- The first path contains nodes [2,1,3,4]: the prices are [7,8,6,10], and the sum of the prices is 31.
- The second path contains the node [2] with the price [7].
The difference between the maximum and minimum price sum is 24. It can be proved that 24 is the maximum cost.

Example 2:


Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2]], price = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The diagram above denotes the tree after rooting it at node 0. The first part (colored in red) shows the path with the maximum price sum. The second part (colored in blue) shows the path with the minimum price sum.
- The first path contains nodes [0,1,2]: the prices are [1,1,1], and the sum of the prices is 3.
- The second path contains node [0] with a price [1].
The difference between the maximum and minimum price sum is 2. It can be proved that 2 is the maximum cost.

Return true if this is possible, otherwise, return false.
An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, using all the original letters exactly once.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcd"", t = ""cdab"", k = 2
Output: true
Explanation:

Split s into 2 substrings of length 2: [""ab"", ""cd""].
Rearranging these substrings as [""cd"", ""ab""], and then concatenating them results in ""cdab"", which matches t.


Example 2:

Input: s = ""aabbcc"", t = ""bbaacc"", k = 3
Output: true
Explanation:

Split s into 3 substrings of length 2: [""aa"", ""bb"", ""cc""].
Rearranging these substrings as [""bb"", ""aa"", ""cc""], and then concatenating them results in ""bbaacc"", which matches t.


Example 3:

```","You are given an integer n representing the number of nodes in a perfect binary tree consisting of nodes numbered from 1 to n. The root of the tree is node 1 and each node i in the tree has two children where the left child is the node 2 * i and the right child is 2 * i + 1.
Each node in the tree also has a cost represented by a given 0-indexed integer array cost of size n where cost[i] is the cost of node i + 1. You are allowed to increment the cost of any node by 1 any number of times.
Return the minimum number of increments you need to make the cost of paths from the root to each leaf node equal.
Note:

A perfect binary tree is a tree where each node, except the leaf nodes, has exactly 2 children.
The cost of a path is the sum of costs of nodes in the path.

 
Example 1:


Input: n = 7, cost = [1,5,2,2,3,3,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: We can do the following increments:
- Increase the cost of node 4 one time.
- Increase the cost of node 3 three times.
- Increase the cost of node 7 two times.
Each path from the root to a leaf will have a total cost of 9.
The total increments we did is 1 + 3 + 2 = 6.
It can be shown that this is the minimum answer we can achieve.

Example 2:


Input: n = 3, cost = [5,3,3]
Output: 0
Explanation: The two paths already have equal total costs, so no increments are needed.

If there are two or more strings in wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix, find the string that is the smallest in length. If there are two or more such strings that have the same smallest length, find the one that occurred earlier in wordsContainer.
Return an array of integers ans, where ans[i] is the index of the string in wordsContainer that has the longest common suffix with wordsQuery[i].
 
Example 1:

Input: wordsContainer = [""abcd"",""bcd"",""xbcd""], wordsQuery = [""cd"",""bcd"",""xyz""]
Output: [1,1,1]
Explanation:
Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = ""cd"", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix ""cd"" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[1] = ""bcd"", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix ""bcd"" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.
For wordsQuery[2] = ""xyz"", there is no string from wordsContainer that shares a common suffix. Hence the longest common suffix is """", that is shared with strings at index 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 1 because it has the shortest length of 3.


Example 2:

Input: wordsContainer = [""abcdefgh"",""poiuygh"",""ghghgh""], wordsQuery = [""gh"",""acbfgh"",""acbfegh""]
Output: [2,0,2]
Explanation:
Let's look at each wordsQuery[i] separately:

For wordsQuery[0] = ""gh"", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix ""gh"" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.
For wordsQuery[1] = ""acbfgh"", only the string at index 0 shares the longest common suffix ""fgh"". Hence it is the answer, even though the string at index 2 is shorter.
For wordsQuery[2] = ""acbfegh"", strings from wordsContainer that share the longest common suffix ""gh"" are at indices 0, 1, and 2. Among these, the answer is the string at index 2 because it has the shortest length of 6.

Explanation: For each index i in the variables array:
1) For the index 0, variables[0] = [2,3,3,10], (23 % 10)3 % 10 = 2.
2) For the index 1, variables[1] = [3,3,3,1], (33 % 10)3 % 1 = 0.

Return true if it is possible to traverse between all such pairs of indices, or false otherwise.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,6]
Output: true
Explanation: In this example, there are 3 possible pairs of indices: (0, 1), (0, 2), and (1, 2).
To go from index 0 to index 1, we can use the sequence of traversals 0 -> 2 -> 1, where we move from index 0 to index 2 because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1, and then move from index 2 to index 1 because gcd(nums[2], nums[1]) = gcd(6, 3) = 3 > 1.
To go from index 0 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[0], nums[2]) = gcd(2, 6) = 2 > 1. Likewise, to go from index 1 to index 2, we can just go directly because gcd(nums[1], nums[2]) = gcd(3, 6) = 3 > 1.

Explanation: No sequence of traversals can take us from index 0 to index 2 in this example. So, we return false.

Explanation: There are 6 possible pairs of indices to traverse between: (0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 3), (1, 2), (1, 3), and (2, 3). A valid sequence of traversals exists for each pair, so we return true.

Input: nums = [2,1,4]
Output: 141
Explanation: 
1st group: [2] has power = 22 * 2 = 8.
2nd group: [1] has power = 12 * 1 = 1. 
3rd group: [4] has power = 42 * 4 = 64. 
4th group: [2,1] has power = 22 * 1 = 4. 
5th group: [2,4] has power = 42 * 2 = 32. 
6th group: [1,4] has power = 42 * 1 = 16. 
​​​​​​​7th group: [2,1,4] has power = 42​​​​​​​ * 1 = 16. 
The sum of powers of all groups is 8 + 1 + 64 + 4 + 32 + 16 + 16 = 141.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 7
Explanation: A total of 7 groups are possible, and the power of each group will be 1. Therefore, the sum of the powers of all groups is 7.

```","You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and removeQueries, both of length n. For the ith query, the element in nums at the index removeQueries[i] is removed, splitting nums into different segments.
A segment is a contiguous sequence of positive integers in nums. A segment sum is the sum of every element in a segment.
Return an integer array answer, of length n, where answer[i] is the maximum segment sum after applying the ith removal.
Note: The same index will not be removed more than once.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,5,6,1], removeQueries = [0,3,2,4,1]
Output: [14,7,2,2,0]
Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:
Query 1: Remove the 0th element, nums becomes [0,2,5,6,1] and the maximum segment sum is 14 for segment [2,5,6,1].
Query 2: Remove the 3rd element, nums becomes [0,2,5,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 7 for segment [2,5].
Query 3: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,1] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 4: Remove the 4th element, nums becomes [0,2,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 2 for segment [2]. 
Query 5: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [0,0,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 0, since there are no segments.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,11,1], removeQueries = [3,2,1,0]
Output: [16,5,3,0]
Explanation: Using 0 to indicate a removed element, the answer is as follows:

Query 2: Remove the 2nd element, nums becomes [3,2,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 5 for segment [3,2].
Query 3: Remove the 1st element, nums becomes [3,0,0,0] and the maximum segment sum is 3 for segment [3].

```","You are given two positive integers left and right with left <= right. Calculate the product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
Since the product may be very large, you will abbreviate it following these steps:

Count all trailing zeros in the product and remove them. Let us denote this count as C.

	
For example, there are 3 trailing zeros in 1000, and there are 0 trailing zeros in 546.


Denote the remaining number of digits in the product as d. If d > 10, then express the product as <pre>...<suf> where <pre> denotes the first 5 digits of the product, and <suf> denotes the last 5 digits of the product after removing all trailing zeros. If d <= 10, we keep it unchanged.
	
For example, we express 1234567654321 as 12345...54321, but 1234567 is represented as 1234567.


Finally, represent the product as a string ""<pre>...<suf>eC"".
	
For example, 12345678987600000 will be represented as ""12345...89876e5"".



Return a string denoting the abbreviated product of all integers in the inclusive range [left, right].
 
Example 1:

Input: left = 1, right = 4
Output: ""24e0""
Explanation: The product is 1 × 2 × 3 × 4 = 24.
There are no trailing zeros, so 24 remains the same. The abbreviation will end with ""e0"".
Since the number of digits is 2, which is less than 10, we do not have to abbreviate it further.
Thus, the final representation is ""24e0"".

Example 2:

Input: left = 2, right = 11
Output: ""399168e2""
Explanation: The product is 39916800.
There are 2 trailing zeros, which we remove to get 399168. The abbreviation will end with ""e2"".
The number of digits after removing the trailing zeros is 6, so we do not abbreviate it further.
Hence, the abbreviated product is ""399168e2"".

Example 3:

Input: left = 371, right = 375
Output: ""7219856259e3""
Explanation: The product is 7219856259000.

We define the mirror of a letter in the English alphabet as its corresponding letter when the alphabet is reversed. For example, the mirror of 'a' is 'z', and the mirror of 'y' is 'b'.
Initially, all characters in the string s are unmarked.
You start with a score of 0, and you perform the following process on the string s:

Iterate through the string from left to right.
At each index i, find the closest unmarked index j such that j < i and s[j] is the mirror of s[i]. Then, mark both indices i and j, and add the value i - j to the total score.
If no such index j exists for the index i, move on to the next index without making any changes.

Return the total score at the end of the process.

i = 0. There is no index j that satisfies the conditions, so we skip.
i = 1. There is no index j that satisfies the conditions, so we skip.
i = 2. The closest index j that satisfies the conditions is j = 0, so we mark both indices 0 and 2, and then add 2 - 0 = 2 to the score.

A region is a 3 x 3 subgrid where the absolute difference in intensity between any two adjacent pixels is less than or equal to threshold.
All pixels in a region belong to that region, note that a pixel can belong to multiple regions.
You need to calculate a m x n grid result, where result[i][j] is the average intensity of the regions to which image[i][j] belongs, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Output: [[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9],[9,9,9,9]]
Explanation:

There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 9, while the average intensity of the second region is 9.67 which is rounded down to 9. The average intensity of both of the regions is (9 + 9) / 2 = 9. As all the pixels belong to either region 1, region 2, or both of them, the intensity of every pixel in the result is 9.
Please note that the rounded-down values are used when calculating the average of multiple regions, hence the calculation is done using 9 as the average intensity of region 2, not 9.67.

Example 2:

Input: image = [[10,20,30],[15,25,35],[20,30,40],[25,35,45]], threshold = 12
Output: [[25,25,25],[27,27,27],[27,27,27],[30,30,30]]
Explanation:

There are two regions as illustrated above. The average intensity of the first region is 25, while the average intensity of the second region is 30. The average intensity of both of the regions is (25 + 30) / 2 = 27.5 which is rounded down to 27.
All the pixels in row 0 of the image belong to region 1, hence all the pixels in row 0 in the result are 25. Similarly, all the pixels in row 3 in the result are 30. The pixels in rows 1 and 2 of the image belong to region 1 and region 2, hence their assigned value is 27 in the result.

Example 3:

Input: image = [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]], threshold = 1
Output: [[5,6,7],[8,9,10],[11,12,13]]
Explanation:
There is only one 3 x 3 subgrid, while it does not have the condition on difference of adjacent pixels, for example, the difference between image[0][0] and image[1][0] is |5 - 8| = 3 > threshold = 1. None of them belong to any valid regions, so the result should be the same as image.

Substrings ""29"", ""129"", ""293"" and ""2936"" are not divisible by their last digit. There are 15 substrings in total, so the answer is 15 - 4 = 11.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""5701283""
Output: 18
Explanation:
Substrings ""01"", ""12"", ""701"", ""012"", ""128"", ""5701"", ""7012"", ""0128"", ""57012"", ""70128"", ""570128"", and ""701283"" are all divisible by their last digit. Additionally, all substrings that are just 1 non-zero digit are divisible by themselves. Since there are 6 such digits, the answer is 12 + 6 = 18.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""1010101010""
Output: 25
Explanation:
Only substrings that end with digit '1' are divisible by their last digit. There are 25 such substrings.

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 105
s consists of digits only.

Choose any integer x such that nums remains non-empty on removing all occurrences of x.
Remove all occurrences of x from the array.

Return the maximum subarray sum across all possible resulting arrays.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [-3,2,-2,-1,3,-2,3]
Output: 7
Explanation:
We can have the following arrays after at most one operation:

The original array is nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
Deleting all occurences of x = -3 results in nums = [2, -2, -1, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
Deleting all occurences of x = -2 results in nums = [-3, 2, -1, 3, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 2 + (-1) + 3 + 3 = 7.
Deleting all occurences of x = -1 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, 3, -2, 3]. The maximum subarray sum is 3 + (-2) + 3 = 4.
Deleting all occurences of x = 3 results in nums = [-3, 2, -2, -1, -2]. The maximum subarray sum is 2.

The output is max(4, 4, 7, 4, 2) = 7.

```","You are given a 0-indexed string array words.
Let's define a boolean function isPrefixAndSuffix that takes two strings, str1 and str2:

isPrefixAndSuffix(str1, str2) returns true if str1 is both a prefix and a suffix of str2, and false otherwise.

For example, isPrefixAndSuffix(""aba"", ""ababa"") is true because ""aba"" is a prefix of ""ababa"" and also a suffix, but isPrefixAndSuffix(""abc"", ""abcd"") is false.
Return an integer denoting the number of index pairs (i, j) such that i < j, and isPrefixAndSuffix(words[i], words[j]) is true.
 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""a"",""aba"",""ababa"",""aa""]
Output: 4
Explanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:
i = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""a"", ""aba"") is true.
i = 0 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""a"", ""ababa"") is true.
i = 0 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""a"", ""aa"") is true.
i = 1 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""aba"", ""ababa"") is true.
Therefore, the answer is 4.
Example 2:

Input: words = [""pa"",""papa"",""ma"",""mama""]
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:
i = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""pa"", ""papa"") is true.
i = 2 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix(""ma"", ""mama"") is true.
Therefore, the answer is 2.  
Example 3:

Input: words = [""abab"",""ab""]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this example, the only valid index pair is i = 0 and j = 1, and isPrefixAndSuffix(""abab"", ""ab"") is false.
Therefore, the answer is 0.

You have to place n people, including Alice and Bob, at these points such that there is exactly one person at every point.

Otherwise, place an amount of coins equal to the maximum product of cost values assigned to 3 distinct nodes in the subtree of node i. If this product is negative, place 0 coins.

Return an array coin of size n such that coin[i] is the number of coins placed at node i.
 
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4],[0,5]], cost = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [120,1,1,1,1,1]
Explanation: For node 0 place 6 * 5 * 4 = 120 coins. All other nodes are leaves with subtree of size 1, place 1 coin on each of them.

Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[2,6],[2,7],[2,8]], cost = [1,4,2,3,5,7,8,-4,2]
Output: [280,140,32,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Explanation: The coins placed on each node are:
- Place 8 * 7 * 5 = 280 coins on node 0.
- Place 7 * 5 * 4 = 140 coins on node 1.
- Place 8 * 2 * 2 = 32 coins on node 2.
- All other nodes are leaves with subtree of size 1, place 1 coin on each of them.

Example 3:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], cost = [1,2,-2]
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation: Node 1 and 2 are leaves with subtree of size 1, place 1 coin on each of them. For node 0 the only possible product of cost is 2 * 1 * -2 = -4. Hence place 0 coins on node 0.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 2 * 104
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < n
cost.length == n
1 <= |cost[i]| <= 104
The input is generated such that edges represents a valid tree.

```","You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. A pair of integers x and y is called a strong pair if it satisfies the condition:

|x - y| <= min(x, y)

You need to select two integers from nums such that they form a strong pair and their bitwise XOR is the maximum among all strong pairs in the array.
Return the maximum XOR value out of all possible strong pairs in the array nums.
Note that you can pick the same integer twice to form a pair.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]

Explanation: There are 11 strong pairs in the array nums: (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5), (4, 4), (4, 5) and (5, 5).
The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is 3 XOR 4 = 7.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,100]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are 2 strong pairs in the array nums: (10, 10) and (100, 100).
The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is 10 XOR 10 = 0 since the pair (100, 100) also gives 100 XOR 100 = 0.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [500,520,2500,3000]
Output: 1020
Explanation: There are 6 strong pairs in the array nums: (500, 500), (500, 520), (520, 520), (2500, 2500), (2500, 3000) and (3000, 3000).
The maximum XOR possible from these pairs is 500 XOR 520 = 1020 since the only other non-zero XOR value is 2500 XOR 3000 = 636.

You are also given a 2D integer array queries of length m, where queries[i] = [ai, bi]. For each query, find the minimum number of operations required to make the weight of every edge on the path from ai to bi equal. In one operation, you can choose any edge of the tree and change its weight to any value.
Note that:

Queries are independent of each other, meaning that the tree returns to its initial state on each new query.
The path from ai to bi is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with node ai and ending with node bi such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.

Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the answer to the ith query.

Explanation: In the first query, all the edges in the path from 0 to 3 have a weight of 1. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the second query, all the edges in the path from 3 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 0.
In the third query, we change the weight of edge [2,3] to 2. After this operation, all the edges in the path from 2 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 1.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,1], [1,2] and [2,3] to 2. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 6 have a weight of 2. Hence, the answer is 3.
For each queries[i], it can be shown that answer[i] is the minimum number of operations needed to equalize all the edge weights in the path from ai to bi.

Example 2:


Input: n = 8, edges = [[1,2,6],[1,3,4],[2,4,6],[2,5,3],[3,6,6],[3,0,8],[7,0,2]], queries = [[4,6],[0,4],[6,5],[7,4]]

In the second query, we change the weight of edges [0,3] and [3,1] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 0 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the third query, we change the weight of edges [1,3] and [5,2] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 6 to 5 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 2.
In the fourth query, we change the weights of edges [0,7], [0,3] and [1,3] to 6. After these operations, all the edges in the path from 7 to 4 have a weight of 6. Hence, the answer is 3.

Input: nums1 = [1,0,1], nums2 = [0,0,0], queries = [[1,1,1],[2,1,0],[3,0,0]]
Output: [3]
Explanation: After the first query nums1 becomes [1,1,1]. After the second query, nums2 becomes [1,1,1], so the answer to the third query is 3. Thus, [3] is returned.

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [1], nums2 = [5], queries = [[2,0,0],[3,0,0]]
Output: [5]
Explanation: After the first query, nums2 remains [5], so the answer to the second query is 5. Thus, [5] is returned.

```","You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words. Each string consists of lowercase English letters only. No letter occurs more than once in any string of words.
Two strings s1 and s2 are said to be connected if the set of letters of s2 can be obtained from the set of letters of s1 by any one of the following operations:

Adding exactly one letter to the set of the letters of s1.
Deleting exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1.
Replacing exactly one letter from the set of the letters of s1 with any letter, including itself.

The array words can be divided into one or more non-intersecting groups. A string belongs to a group if any one of the following is true:

It is connected to at least one other string of the group.
It is the only string present in the group.

Note that the strings in words should be grouped in such a manner that a string belonging to a group cannot be connected to a string present in any other group. It can be proved that such an arrangement is always unique.
Return an array ans of size 2 where:

ans[0] is the maximum number of groups words can be divided into, and
ans[1] is the size of the largest group.

 
Example 1:

Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""ab"",""cde""]
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
- words[0] can be used to obtain words[1] (by replacing 'a' with 'b'), and words[2] (by adding 'b'). So words[0] is connected to words[1] and words[2].
- words[1] can be used to obtain words[0] (by replacing 'b' with 'a'), and words[2] (by adding 'a'). So words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].
- words[2] can be used to obtain words[0] (by deleting 'b'), and words[1] (by deleting 'a'). So words[2] is connected to words[0] and words[1].
- words[3] is not connected to any string in words.
Thus, words can be divided into 2 groups [""a"",""b"",""ab""] and [""cde""]. The size of the largest group is 3.  

Example 2:

Input: words = [""a"",""ab"",""abc""]
Output: [1,3]
Explanation:
- words[0] is connected to words[1].
- words[1] is connected to words[0] and words[2].
- words[2] is connected to words[1].
Since all strings are connected to each other, they should be grouped together.
Thus, the size of the largest group is 3.

The ith (0-indexed) request arrives.
If all servers are busy, the request is dropped (not handled at all).
If the (i % k)th server is available, assign the request to that server.
Otherwise, assign the request to the next available server (wrapping around the list of servers and starting from 0 if necessary). For example, if the ith server is busy, try to assign the request to the (i+1)th server, then the (i+2)th server, and so on.

You are given a strictly increasing array arrival of positive integers, where arrival[i] represents the arrival time of the ith request, and another array load, where load[i] represents the load of the ith request (the time it takes to complete). Your goal is to find the busiest server(s). A server is considered busiest if it handled the most number of requests successfully among all the servers.
Return a list containing the IDs (0-indexed) of the busiest server(s). You may return the IDs in any order.
 
Example 1:


Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3] 
Output: [1] 
Explanation: 
All of the servers start out available.
The first 3 requests are handled by the first 3 servers in order.
Request 3 comes in. Server 0 is busy, so it's assigned to the next available server, which is 1.
Request 4 comes in. It cannot be handled since all servers are busy, so it is dropped.
Servers 0 and 2 handled one request each, while server 1 handled two requests. Hence server 1 is the busiest server.

Example 2:

Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4], load = [1,2,1,2]
Output: [0]
Explanation: 
The first 3 requests are handled by first 3 servers.
Request 3 comes in. It is handled by server 0 since the server is available.
Server 0 handled two requests, while servers 1 and 2 handled one request each. Hence server 0 is the busiest server.

Example 3:

Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3], load = [10,12,11]
Output: [0,1,2]
Explanation: Each server handles a single request, so they are all considered the busiest.

In the second round Alice divides the row to [6], [2,3]. This time Bob throws away the left row and Alice's score becomes 16 (11 + 5).
The last round Alice has only one choice to divide the row which is [2], [3]. Bob throws away the right row and Alice's score is now 18 (16 + 2). The game ends because only one stone is remaining in the row.

Choose any two elements from the first three elements of nums and remove them. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the two elements removed.
If fewer than three elements remain in nums, remove all the remaining elements in a single operation. The cost of this operation is the maximum of the remaining elements.

Return the minimum cost required to remove all the elements.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [6,2,8,4]

Explanation:
Initially, nums = [6, 2, 8, 4].

In the first operation, remove nums[0] = 6 and nums[2] = 8 with a cost of max(6, 8) = 8. Now, nums = [2, 4].
In the second operation, remove the remaining elements with a cost of max(2, 4) = 4.

The cost to remove all elements is 8 + 4 = 12. This is the minimum cost to remove all elements in nums. Hence, the output is 12.

These represent the start and end times of n non-overlapping meetings that occur during the event between time t = 0 and time t = eventTime, where the ith meeting occurs during the time [startTime[i], endTime[i]].
You can reschedule at most one meeting by moving its start time while maintaining the same duration, such that the meetings remain non-overlapping, to maximize the longest continuous period of free time during the event.
Return the maximum amount of free time possible after rearranging the meetings.
Note that the meetings can not be rescheduled to a time outside the event and they should remain non-overlapping.
Note: In this version, it is valid for the relative ordering of the meetings to change after rescheduling one meeting.
 
Example 1:

Input: eventTime = 5, startTime = [1,3], endTime = [2,5]

Explanation:

Reschedule the meeting at [1, 2] to [2, 3], leaving no meetings during the time [0, 2].

Example 2:

Input: eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,7,9], endTime = [1,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation:

Reschedule the meeting at [0, 1] to [8, 9], leaving no meetings during the time [0, 7].

Example 3:

Input: eventTime = 10, startTime = [0,3,7,9], endTime = [1,4,8,10]
Output: 6
Explanation:

Example 4:

Input: eventTime = 5, startTime = [0,1,2,3,4], endTime = [1,2,3,4,5]

```","You are given an integer numberOfUsers representing the total number of users and an array events of size n x 3.
Each events[i] can be either of the following two types:

Message Event: [""MESSAGE"", ""timestampi"", ""mentions_stringi""]

This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at timestampi.
The mentions_stringi string can contain one of the following tokens:
		
id<number>: where <number> is an integer in range [0,numberOfUsers - 1]. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
ALL: mentions all users.
HERE: mentions all online users.




Offline Event: [""OFFLINE"", ""timestampi"", ""idi""]

This event indicates that the user idi had become offline at timestampi for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time timestampi + 60.



Return an array mentions where mentions[i] represents the number of mentions the user with id i has across all MESSAGE events.
All users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.
Note that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.
 
Example 1:

Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[""MESSAGE"",""10"",""id1 id0""],[""OFFLINE"",""11"",""0""],[""MESSAGE"",""71"",""HERE""]]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
Initially, all users are online.
At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]
At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.
At timestamp 71, id0 comes back online and ""HERE"" is mentioned. mentions = [2,2]

Example 2:

Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[""MESSAGE"",""10"",""id1 id0""],[""OFFLINE"",""11"",""0""],[""MESSAGE"",""12"",""ALL""]]
Output: [2,2]
Explanation:
Initially, all users are online.
At timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]
At timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.
At timestamp 12, ""ALL"" is mentioned. This includes offline users, so both id0 and id1 are mentioned. mentions = [2,2]

Example 3:

Input: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[""OFFLINE"",""10"",""0""],[""MESSAGE"",""12"",""HERE""]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation:
Initially, all users are online.
At timestamp 10, id0 goes offline.
At timestamp 12, ""HERE"" is mentioned. Because id0 is still offline, they will not be mentioned. mentions = [0,1]

 
Constraints:

1 <= numberOfUsers <= 100
1 <= events.length <= 100
events[i].length == 3
events[i][0] will be one of MESSAGE or OFFLINE.
1 <= int(events[i][1]) <= 105
The number of id<number> mentions in any ""MESSAGE"" event is between 1 and 100.
0 <= <number> <= numberOfUsers - 1
It is guaranteed that the user id referenced in the OFFLINE event is online at the time the event occurs.

The output would be 24.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,0,6], k = 1
Output: 22
Explanation: 
For subsequences with exactly 1 element, the minimum and maximum values are the element itself. Therefore, the total is 5 + 5 + 0 + 0 + 6 + 6 = 22.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 12
Explanation:
The subsequences [1, 1] and [1] each appear 3 times. For all of them, the minimum and maximum are both 1. Thus, the total is 12.

Choose any element in arr and add or subtract a positive integer x to it. The cost of this operation is x.


Return the minimum total cost to make arr equal to brr.
 
Example 1:

Input: arr = [-7,9,5], brr = [7,-2,-5], k = 2
Output: 13
Explanation:

Split arr into two contiguous subarrays: [-7] and [9, 5] and rearrange them as [9, 5, -7], with a cost of 2.
Subtract 2 from element arr[0]. The array becomes [7, 5, -7]. The cost of this operation is 2.
Subtract 7 from element arr[1]. The array becomes [7, -2, -7]. The cost of this operation is 7.
Add 2 to element arr[2]. The array becomes [7, -2, -5]. The cost of this operation is 2.

The total cost to make the arrays equal is 2 + 2 + 7 + 2 = 13.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [2,1], brr = [2,1], k = 0

```","Bob is stuck in a dungeon and must break n locks, each requiring some amount of energy to break. The required energy for each lock is stored in an array called strength where strength[i] indicates the energy needed to break the ith lock.
To break a lock, Bob uses a sword with the following characteristics:

The initial energy of the sword is 0.
The initial factor x by which the energy of the sword increases is 1.
Every minute, the energy of the sword increases by the current factor x.
To break the ith lock, the energy of the sword must reach at least strength[i].
After breaking a lock, the energy of the sword resets to 0, and the factor x increases by a given value k.

Your task is to determine the minimum time in minutes required for Bob to break all n locks and escape the dungeon.
Return the minimum time required for Bob to break all n locks.

Input: strength = [3,4,1], k = 1

```","Given an array nums of n integers, your task is to find the maximum value of k for which there exist two adjacent subarrays of length k each, such that both subarrays are strictly increasing. Specifically, check if there are two subarrays of length k starting at indices a and b (a < b), where:

Both subarrays nums[a..a + k - 1] and nums[b..b + k - 1] are strictly increasing.
The subarrays must be adjacent, meaning b = a + k.

Return the maximum possible value of k.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,7,8,9,2,3,4,3,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:

The subarray starting at index 2 is [7, 8, 9], which is strictly increasing.
The subarray starting at index 5 is [2, 3, 4], which is also strictly increasing.
These two subarrays are adjacent, and 3 is the maximum possible value of k for which two such adjacent strictly increasing subarrays exist.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,4,4,4,5,6,7]
Output: 2
Explanation:

The subarray starting at index 0 is [1, 2], which is strictly increasing.
The subarray starting at index 2 is [3, 4], which is also strictly increasing.
These two subarrays are adjacent, and 2 is the maximum possible value of k for which two such adjacent strictly increasing subarrays exist.

```","You are given an integer array nums with length n.
The cost of a subarray nums[l..r], where 0 <= l <= r < n, is defined as:
cost(l, r) = nums[l] - nums[l + 1] + ... + nums[r] * (−1)r − l
Your task is to split nums into subarrays such that the total cost of the subarrays is maximized, ensuring each element belongs to exactly one subarray.
Formally, if nums is split into k subarrays, where k > 1, at indices i1, i2, ..., ik − 1, where 0 <= i1 < i2 < ... < ik - 1 < n - 1, then the total cost will be:
cost(0, i1) + cost(i1 + 1, i2) + ... + cost(ik − 1 + 1, n − 1)
Return an integer denoting the maximum total cost of the subarrays after splitting the array optimally.
Note: If nums is not split into subarrays, i.e. k = 1, the total cost is simply cost(0, n - 1).
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,-2,3,4]
Output: 10
Explanation:
One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -2, 3, 4] into subarrays [1, -2, 3] and [4]. The total cost will be (1 + 2 + 3) + 4 = 10.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,-1,1,-1]
Output: 4
Explanation:
One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -1, 1, -1] into subarrays [1, -1] and [1, -1]. The total cost will be (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: 0
Explanation:
We cannot split the array further, so the answer is 0.

Example 4:

Input: nums = [1,-1]
Output: 2
Explanation:
Selecting the whole array gives a total cost of 1 + 1 = 2, which is the maximum.

You are given a string s, Alice and Bob will take turns playing the following game where Alice starts first:

On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an odd number of vowels.
On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring from s that contains an even number of vowels.

The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. We assume that both Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.
The English vowels are: a, e, i, o, and u.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""leetcoder""
Output: true
Explanation:
Alice can win the game as follows:

Alice plays first, she can delete the underlined substring in s = ""leetcoder"" which contains 3 vowels. The resulting string is s = ""der"".
Bob plays second, he can delete the underlined substring in s = ""der"" which contains 0 vowels. The resulting string is s = ""er"".
Alice plays third, she can delete the whole string s = ""er"" which contains 1 vowel.
Bob plays fourth, since the string is empty, there is no valid play for Bob. So Alice wins the game.


Example 2:

Input: s = ""bbcd""
Output: false
Explanation:
There is no valid play for Alice in her first turn, so Alice loses the game.

```","You are given an array of positive integers nums.
You need to select a subset of nums which satisfies the following condition:

You can place the selected elements in a 0-indexed array such that it follows the pattern: [x, x2, x4, ..., xk/2, xk, xk/2, ..., x4, x2, x] (Note that k can be be any non-negative power of 2). For example, [2, 4, 16, 4, 2] and [3, 9, 3] follow the pattern while [2, 4, 8, 4, 2] does not.

Return the maximum number of elements in a subset that satisfies these conditions.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,4,1,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can select the subset {4,2,2}, which can be placed in the array as [2,4,2] which follows the pattern and 22 == 4. Hence the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,2,4]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can select the subset {1}, which can be placed in the array as [1] which follows the pattern. Hence the answer is 1. Note that we could have also selected the subsets {2}, {3}, or {4}, there may be multiple subsets which provide the same answer.

```","You are given a 0-indexed array of positive integers nums.
In one operation, you can swap any two adjacent elements if they have the same number of set bits. You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).
Return true if you can sort the array in ascending order, else return false.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]
Output: true
Explanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element. The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation ""10"", ""100"", and ""1000"" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation ""1111"" and ""11110"".
We can sort the array using 4 operations:
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].
The array has become sorted, hence we return true.
Note that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: true
Explanation: The array is already sorted, hence we return true.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [3,16,8,4,2]
Output: false
Explanation: It can be shown that it is not possible to sort the input array using any number of operations.

(c, d) denotes the position of the white bishop.
(e, f) denotes the position of the black queen.

Given that you can only move the white pieces, return the minimum number of moves required to capture the black queen.
Note that:

Rooks can move any number of squares either vertically or horizontally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
Bishops can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
A rook or a bishop can capture the queen if it is located in a square that they can move to.
The queen does not move.

 
Example 1:


Input: a = 1, b = 1, c = 8, d = 8, e = 2, f = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: We can capture the black queen in two moves by moving the white rook to (1, 3) then to (2, 3).
It is impossible to capture the black queen in less than two moves since it is not being attacked by any of the pieces at the beginning.

Example 2:


Input: a = 5, b = 3, c = 3, d = 4, e = 5, f = 2
Output: 1

- Move the white rook to (5, 2).
- Move the white bishop to (5, 2).

Second operation on enemy 0: currentEnergy increases by 3, and enemy 0 is marked. So, points = 1, currentEnergy = 3, and marked enemies = [0].
First operation on enemy 2: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 2, currentEnergy = 1, and marked enemies = [0].
Second operation on enemy 2: currentEnergy increases by 2, and enemy 2 is marked. So, points = 2, currentEnergy = 3, and marked enemies = [0, 2].
First operation on enemy 1: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 3, currentEnergy = 1, and marked enemies = [0, 2].

Explanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 3 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [3,3,3,3,3] using 4 special moves is given by |1 - 3| + |2 - 3| + |4 - 3| + |5 - 3| = 6.
It can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 3 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,12,13,14,15]
Output: 11
Explanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 11 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [11,11,11,11,11] using 5 special moves is given by |10 - 11| + |12 - 11| + |13 - 11| + |14 - 11| + |15 - 11| = 11.
It can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 11 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [22,33,22,33,22]
Output: 22
Explanation: We can make the array equalindromic by changing all elements to 22 which is a palindromic number. The cost of changing the array to [22,22,22,22,22] using 2 special moves is given by |33 - 22| + |33 - 22| = 22.
It can be shown that changing all elements to any palindromic number other than 22 cannot be achieved at a lower cost.

Output: 11
Explanation: We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the root is non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf is different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.

- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] = 40.
It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

Explanation: We can do the following operations:
- Choose i = 3 and apply the second operation. The resulting string is s1 = ""1101111000"".
- Choose i = 4 and apply the second operation. The resulting string is s1 = ""1101001000"".

Explanation: 
Take three characters from the left of s. You now have two 'a' characters, and one 'b' character.
Take five characters from the right of s. You now have four 'a' characters, two 'b' characters, and two 'c' characters.
A total of 3 + 5 = 8 minutes is needed.

```","There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
At every node i, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:

the price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,
the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.

The game goes on as follows:

Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.
At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.
For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
	
If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c, both of them receive c / 2 each.


If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.

Return the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node.
 
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
  Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
  Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
  Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.

Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280. 

 
Constraints:

2 <= n <= 105
edges.length == n - 1
edges[i].length == 2
0 <= ai, bi < n
ai != bi
edges represents a valid tree.
1 <= bob < n
amount.length == n
amount[i] is an even integer in the range [-104, 104].

Select any index i (where 0 <= i < n) and flip s[i]. If s[i] == '1', change s[i] to '0' and vice versa.

You need to minimize the length of the longest substring of s such that all the characters in the substring are identical.

Example 1:

Input: caption = ""cdcd""
Output: ""cccc""
Explanation:
It can be shown that the given caption cannot be transformed into a good caption with fewer than 2 operations. The possible good captions that can be created using exactly 2 operations are:

""dddd"": Change caption[0] and caption[2] to their next character 'd'.
""cccc"": Change caption[1] and caption[3] to their previous character 'c'.

Since ""cccc"" is lexicographically smaller than ""dddd"", return ""cccc"".

Example 2:

Input: caption = ""aca""
Output: ""aaa""
Explanation:
It can be proven that the given caption requires at least 2 operations to be transformed into a good caption. The only good caption that can be obtained with exactly 2 operations is as follows:

Operation 1: Change caption[1] to 'b'. caption = ""aba"".
Operation 2: Change caption[1] to 'a'. caption = ""aaa"".

Thus, return ""aaa"".

Explanation:


Node 2 has edges with 3 other nodes. We remove the edge [0, 2, 2], ensuring that no node has edges with more than k = 2 nodes.
The sum of weights is 22, and we can't achieve a greater sum. Thus, the answer is 22.

Return an array of n integers answer, where answer[i] is the maximum possible number of nodes that are target to node i of the first tree if you had to connect one node from the first tree to another node in the second tree.
Note that queries are independent from each other. That is, for every query you will remove the added edge before proceeding to the next query.
 
Example 1:

Input: edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,7],[1,4],[4,5],[4,6]]
Output: [8,7,7,8,8]
Explanation:

For i = 0, connect node 0 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
For i = 1, connect node 1 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.
For i = 2, connect node 2 from the first tree to node 7 from the second tree.
For i = 3, connect node 3 from the first tree to node 0 from the second tree.
For i = 4, connect node 4 from the first tree to node 4 from the second tree.


Example 2:

Input: edges1 = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[0,4]], edges2 = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: [3,6,6,6,6]
Explanation:
For every i, connect node i of the first tree with any node of the second tree.

 
Constraints:

2 <= n, m <= 105
edges1.length == n - 1
edges2.length == m - 1
edges1[i].length == edges2[i].length == 2
edges1[i] = [ai, bi]
0 <= ai, bi < n
edges2[i] = [ui, vi]
0 <= ui, vi < m
The input is generated such that edges1 and edges2 represent valid trees.

If s[i] == 'W', Alice summons a Water Serpent.
If s[i] == 'E', Alice summons an Earth Golem.

Bob’s sequence of moves is unknown, but it is guaranteed that Bob will never summon the same creature in two consecutive rounds. Bob beats Alice if the total number of points awarded to Bob after n rounds is strictly greater than the points awarded to Alice.
Return the number of distinct sequences Bob can use to beat Alice.
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""FFF""
Output: 3
Explanation:
Bob can beat Alice by making one of the following sequences of moves: ""WFW"", ""FWF"", or ""WEW"". Note that other winning sequences like ""WWE"" or ""EWW"" are invalid since Bob cannot make the same move twice in a row.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""FWEFW""
Output: 18
Explanation:
Bob can beat Alice by making one of the following sequences of moves: ""FWFWF"", ""FWFWE"", ""FWEFE"", ""FWEWE"", ""FEFWF"", ""FEFWE"", ""FEFEW"", ""FEWFE"", ""WFEFE"", ""WFEWE"", ""WEFWF"", ""WEFWE"", ""WEFEF"", ""WEFEW"", ""WEWFW"", ""WEWFE"", ""EWFWE"", or ""EWEWE"".

 
Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 1000
s[i] is one of 'F', 'W', or 'E'.

```","There is a 50 x 50 chessboard with one knight and some pawns on it. You are given two integers kx and ky where (kx, ky) denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array positions where positions[i] = [xi, yi] denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard.
Alice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn:

The player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the fewest possible moves. Note that the player can select any pawn, it might not be one that can be captured in the least number of moves.
In the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight may pass other pawns without capturing them. Only the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.

Alice is trying to maximize the sum of the number of moves made by both players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to minimize them.
Return the maximum total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play optimally.
Note that in one move, a chess knight has eight possible positions it can move to, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

 
Example 1:

Input: kx = 1, ky = 1, positions = [[0,0]]
Output: 4
Explanation:

The knight takes 4 moves to reach the pawn at (0, 0).

Example 2:

Input: kx = 0, ky = 2, positions = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 8
Explanation:


Alice picks the pawn at (2, 2) and captures it in two moves: (0, 2) -> (1, 4) -> (2, 2).
Bob picks the pawn at (3, 3) and captures it in two moves: (2, 2) -> (4, 1) -> (3, 3).
Alice picks the pawn at (1, 1) and captures it in four moves: (3, 3) -> (4, 1) -> (2, 2) -> (0, 3) -> (1, 1).


Example 3:

Input: kx = 0, ky = 0, positions = [[1,2],[2,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation:

Alice picks the pawn at (2, 4) and captures it in two moves: (0, 0) -> (1, 2) -> (2, 4). Note that the pawn at (1, 2) is not captured.
Bob picks the pawn at (1, 2) and captures it in one move: (2, 4) -> (1, 2).


 
Constraints:

0 <= kx, ky <= 49
1 <= positions.length <= 15
positions[i].length == 2
0 <= positions[i][0], positions[i][1] <= 49
All positions[i] are unique.
The input is generated such that positions[i] != [kx, ky] for all 0 <= i < positions.length.

For each query, you must find the maximum XOR score of any subarray of nums[li..ri].
The XOR score of an array a is found by repeatedly applying the following operations on a so that only one element remains, that is the score:

Simultaneously replace a[i] with a[i] XOR a[i + 1] for all indices i except the last one.
Remove the last element of a.

Initially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.

Choose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3], changeIndices = [1,3,2,2,2,2,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Set nums[changeIndices[1]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,3].
Second 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0].
Second 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0].
Second 4: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Second 5: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.
Hence, the answer is 6.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,2], changeIndices = [1,2,1,2,1,2,1,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Mark index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Second 2: Mark index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 3: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,1].
Second 4: Decrement index 4 by one. nums becomes [0,0,1,0].
Second 5: Decrement index 3 by one. nums becomes [0,0,0,0].
Second 6: Mark index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
Second 7: Mark index 4, since nums[4] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 7th second.
Hence, the answer is 7.

Example 3:

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.
 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""accca"", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
The optimal way is to change s[2] to something other than a and c, for example, b. then it becomes ""acbca"".
Then we perform the operations:

The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is ""ac"", we remove it and s becomes ""bca"".
Now The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is ""bc"", so we remove it and s becomes ""a"".
Finally, we remove ""a"" and s becomes empty, so the procedure ends.

Doing the operations, the string is divided into 3 partitions, so the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""aabaab"", k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
Initially s contains 2 distinct characters, so whichever character we change, it will contain at most 3 distinct characters, so the longest prefix with at most 3 distinct characters would always be all of it, therefore the answer is 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""xxyz"", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
The optimal way is to change s[0] or s[1] to something other than characters in s, for example, to change s[0] to w.
Then s becomes ""wxyz"", which consists of 4 distinct characters, so as k is 1, it will divide into 4 partitions.

```","You are given an integer n and an array sick sorted in increasing order, representing positions of infected people in a line of n people.
At each step, one uninfected person adjacent to an infected person gets infected. This process continues until everyone is infected.
An infection sequence is the order in which uninfected people become infected, excluding those initially infected.
Return the number of different infection sequences possible, modulo 109+7.
 
Example 1:

Input: n = 5, sick = [0,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
There is a total of 6 different sequences overall.

Valid infection sequences are [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [3,2,1] and [3,1,2].
[2,3,1] and [2,1,3] are not valid infection sequences because the person at index 2 cannot be infected at the first step.


Example 2:

Input: n = 4, sick = [1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There is a total of 6 different sequences overall.

Valid infection sequences are [0,2,3], [2,0,3] and [2,3,0].
[3,2,0], [3,0,2], and [0,3,2] are not valid infection sequences because the infection starts at the person at index 1, then the order of infection is 2, then 3, and hence 3 cannot be infected earlier than 2.

You can perform any number of operations, where each operation involves selecting a subarray of the array and replacing it with the sum of its elements. For example, if the given array is [1,3,5,6] and you select subarray [3,5] the array will convert to [1,8,6].
Return the maximum length of a non-decreasing array that can be made after applying operations.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: This array with length 3 is not non-decreasing.
We have two ways to make the array length two.
First, choosing subarray [2,2] converts the array to [5,4].
Second, choosing subarray [5,2] converts the array to [7,2].
In these two ways the array is not non-decreasing.
And if we choose subarray [5,2,2] and replace it with [9] it becomes non-decreasing. 
So the answer is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: The array is non-decreasing. So the answer is 4.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [4,3,2,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: Replacing [3,2] with [5] converts the given array to [4,5,6] that is non-decreasing.

Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ai:bi], where 0 <= ai <= bi < n / 2.
Rearrange the characters within the substring s[ci:di], where n / 2 <= ci <= di < n.

For each query, your task is to determine whether it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing the operations.
Each query is answered independently of the others.
Return a 0-indexed array answer, where answer[i] == true if it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing operations specified by the ith query, and false otherwise.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
s[x:y] represents the substring consisting of characters from the index x to index y in s, both inclusive.

 
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcabc"", queries = [[1,1,3,5],[0,2,5,5]]
Output: [true,true]
Explanation: In this example, there are two queries:
In the first query:
- a0 = 1, b0 = 1, c0 = 3, d0 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:1] => abcabc and s[3:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[3:5] can be rearranged to become => abccba.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.
In the second query:
- a1 = 0, b1 = 2, c1 = 5, d1 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abcabc and s[5:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[0:2] can be rearranged to become => cbaabc.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[1] = true.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbcdecbba"", queries = [[0,2,7,9]]
Output: [false]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 0, b0 = 2, c0 = 7, d0 = 9.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abbcdecbba and s[7:9] => abbcdecbba.
It is not possible to make s a palindrome by rearranging these substrings because s[3:6] is not a palindrome.
So, answer[0] = false.
Example 3:

Input: s = ""acbcab"", queries = [[1,2,4,5]]
Output: [true]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 1, b0 = 2, c0 = 4, d0 = 5.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:2] => acbcab and s[4:5] => acbcab.
To make s a palindrome s[1:2] can be rearranged to become abccab.
Then, s[4:5] can be rearranged to become abccba.
Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.

```","There exists an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given a 0-indexed array coins of size n where coins[i] indicates the number of coins in the vertex i, and an integer k.
Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected.
Coins at nodei can be collected in one of the following ways:

Collect all the coins, but you will get coins[i] - k points. If coins[i] - k is negative then you will lose abs(coins[i] - k) points.
Collect all the coins, but you will get floor(coins[i] / 2) points. If this way is used, then for all the nodej present in the subtree of nodei, coins[j] will get reduced to floor(coins[j] / 2).

Return the maximum points you can get after collecting the coins from all the tree nodes.
 
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3]], coins = [10,10,3,3], k = 5
Output: 11                        
Explanation: 
Collect all the coins from node 0 using the first way. Total points = 10 - 5 = 5.
Collect all the coins from node 1 using the first way. Total points = 5 + (10 - 5) = 10.
Collect all the coins from node 2 using the second way so coins left at node 3 will be floor(3 / 2) = 1. Total points = 10 + floor(3 / 2) = 11.
Collect all the coins from node 3 using the second way. Total points = 11 + floor(1 / 2) = 11.
It can be shown that the maximum points we can get after collecting coins from all the nodes is 11. 

Example 2:
 

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], coins = [8,4,4], k = 0
Output: 16
Explanation: 
Coins will be collected from all the nodes using the first way. Therefore, total points = (8 - 0) + (4 - 0) + (4 - 0) = 16.

That is, values[i][j] >= values[i][j + 1] for all 0 <= j < n - 1.
On each day, you would like to buy a single item from one of the shops. Specifically, On the dth day you can:

Pick any shop i.

A stepping number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of exactly 1.
Return an integer denoting the count of stepping numbers in the inclusive range [low, high]. 
Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note: A stepping number should not have a leading zero.
 
Example 1:

Input: low = ""1"", high = ""11""
Output: 10
Explanation: The stepping numbers in the range [1,11] are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10. There are a total of 10 stepping numbers in the range. Hence, the output is 10.
Example 2:

Input: low = ""90"", high = ""101""
Output: 2
Explanation: The stepping numbers in the range [90,101] are 98 and 101. There are a total of 2 stepping numbers in the range. Hence, the output is 2.

```","Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome are minimized.
Return the minimum number of letter changes required.
A semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:​

Choose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.
For a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.
The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.

Consider the string ""abcabc"":

The length of ""abcabc"" is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3.
For d = 1: The entire string ""abcabc"" forms one group. Not a palindrome.
For d = 2:
	
Group 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): ""acb""
Group 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): ""bac""
Neither group forms a palindrome.


For d = 3:
	
Group 1 (positions 1, 4): ""aa""
Group 2 (positions 2, 5): ""bb""
Group 3 (positions 3, 6): ""cc""
All groups form palindromes. Therefore, ""abcabc"" is a semi-palindrome.



 
Example 1: 

Input:   s = ""abcac"", k = 2 
Output:   1 
Explanation:  Divide s into ""ab"" and ""cac"". ""cac"" is already semi-palindrome. Change ""ab"" to ""aa"", it becomes semi-palindrome with d = 1.

Example 2: 

Input:   s = ""abcdef"", k = 2 
Output:   2 
Explanation:  Divide s into substrings ""abc"" and ""def"". Each needs one change to become semi-palindrome.

Example 3: 

Input:   s = ""aabbaa"", k = 3 
Output:   0 
Explanation:  Divide s into substrings ""aa"", ""bb"" and ""aa"". All are already semi-palindromes.

 
Constraints:

2 <= s.length <= 200
1 <= k <= s.length / 2
s contains only lowercase English letters.

```","You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and an integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi with weight wi.
Some edges have a weight of -1 (wi = -1), while others have a positive weight (wi > 0).
Your task is to modify all edges with a weight of -1 by assigning them positive integer values in the range [1, 2 * 109] so that the shortest distance between the nodes source and destination becomes equal to an integer target. If there are multiple modifications that make the shortest distance between source and destination equal to target, any of them will be considered correct.
Return an array containing all edges (even unmodified ones) in any order if it is possible to make the shortest distance from source to destination equal to target, or an empty array if it's impossible.
Note: You are not allowed to modify the weights of edges with initial positive weights.
 
Example 1:


Input: n = 5, edges = [[4,1,-1],[2,0,-1],[0,3,-1],[4,3,-1]], source = 0, destination = 1, target = 5
Output: [[4,1,1],[2,0,1],[0,3,3],[4,3,1]]
Explanation: The graph above shows a possible modification to the edges, making the distance from 0 to 1 equal to 5.

Example 2:


Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,-1],[0,2,5]], source = 0, destination = 2, target = 6
Output: []
Explanation: The graph above contains the initial edges. It is not possible to make the distance from 0 to 2 equal to 6 by modifying the edge with weight -1. So, an empty array is returned.

Example 3:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,-1]], source = 0, destination = 2, target = 6
Output: [[1,0,4],[1,2,3],[2,3,5],[0,3,1]]

lcp[i][j] is equal to the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings word[i,n-1] and word[j,n-1].

Given an n x n matrix lcp, return the alphabetically smallest string word that corresponds to lcp. If there is no such string, return an empty string.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. For example, ""aabd"" is lexicographically smaller than ""aaca"" because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and 'b' comes before 'c'.
 
Example 1:

```","You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.
Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.
The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.
Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.
Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.
 
Example 1:

Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
So the minimum power of a city is 5.
Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.

Example 2:

Input: stations = [4,4,4,4], r = 0, k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: 
It can be proved that we cannot make the minimum power of a city greater than 4.

```","You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.
You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:

Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.
Note:

The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.

 
Example 1:


Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).

Example 2:


Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
Output: [3,2,3,2]
Explanation: We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).

 
Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is n.
2 <= n <= 105
1 <= Node.val <= n
All the values in the tree are unique.
m == queries.length
1 <= m <= min(n, 104)
1 <= queries[i] <= n

You are given a 0-indexed integer array flowers of size n, where flowers[i] is the number of flowers already planted in the ith garden. Flowers that are already planted cannot be removed. You are then given another integer newFlowers, which is the maximum number of flowers that Alice can additionally plant. You are also given the integers target, full, and partial.
A garden is considered complete if it has at least target flowers. The total beauty of the gardens is then determined as the sum of the following:

The number of complete gardens multiplied by full.
The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.

Return the maximum total beauty that Alice can obtain after planting at most newFlowers flowers.
 
Example 1:

Input: flowers = [1,3,1,1], newFlowers = 7, target = 6, full = 12, partial = 1
Output: 14
Explanation: Alice can plant
- 2 flowers in the 0th garden
- 3 flowers in the 1st garden
- 1 flower in the 2nd garden
- 1 flower in the 3rd garden
The gardens will then be [3,6,2,2]. She planted a total of 2 + 3 + 1 + 1 = 7 flowers.
There is 1 garden that is complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 2.
Thus, the total beauty is 1 * 12 + 2 * 1 = 12 + 2 = 14.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 14.

Example 2:

Input: flowers = [2,4,5,3], newFlowers = 10, target = 5, full = 2, partial = 6
Output: 30
Explanation: Alice can plant
- 3 flowers in the 0th garden
- 0 flowers in the 1st garden
- 0 flowers in the 2nd garden
- 2 flowers in the 3rd garden
The gardens will then be [5,4,5,5]. She planted a total of 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 5 flowers.
There are 3 gardens that are complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 4.
Thus, the total beauty is 3 * 2 + 4 * 6 = 6 + 24 = 30.
No other way of planting flowers can obtain a total beauty higher than 30.
Note that Alice could make all the gardens complete but in this case, she would obtain a lower total beauty.

```","A scenic location is represented by its name and attractiveness score, where name is a unique string among all locations and score is an integer. Locations can be ranked from the best to the worst. The higher the score, the better the location. If the scores of two locations are equal, then the location with the lexicographically smaller name is better.
You are building a system that tracks the ranking of locations with the system initially starting with no locations. It supports:

Adding scenic locations, one at a time.
Querying the ith best location of all locations already added, where i is the number of times the system has been queried (including the current query).
	
For example, when the system is queried for the 4th time, it returns the 4th best location of all locations already added.



Note that the test data are generated so that at any time, the number of queries does not exceed the number of locations added to the system.
Implement the SORTracker class:

SORTracker() Initializes the tracker system.
void add(string name, int score) Adds a scenic location with name and score to the system.
string get() Queries and returns the ith best location, where i is the number of times this method has been invoked (including this invocation).

Output
[null, null, null, ""branford"", null, ""alps"", null, ""bradford"", null, ""bradford"", null, ""bradford"", ""orland""]

Explanation
SORTracker tracker = new SORTracker(); // Initialize the tracker system.
tracker.add(""bradford"", 2); // Add location with name=""bradford"" and score=2 to the system.
tracker.add(""branford"", 3); // Add location with name=""branford"" and score=3 to the system.

                            // Note that branford precedes bradford due to its higher score (3 > 2).
                            // This is the 1st time get() is called, so return the best location: ""branford"".

                            // This is because ""alps"" is lexicographically smaller than ""bradford"".
                            // Return the 2nd best location ""alps"", as it is the 2nd time get() is called.

```","You have n tasks and m workers. Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).
Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.
Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.
 
Example 1:

Input: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1
Output: 3
Explanation:
We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:
- Give the magical pill to worker 0.
- Assign worker 0 to task 2 (0 + 1 >= 1)
- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (3 >= 2)
- Assign worker 2 to task 0 (3 >= 3)

Example 2:

Input: tasks = [5,4], workers = [0,0,0], pills = 1, strength = 5
Output: 1
Explanation:
We can assign the magical pill and tasks as follows:
- Give the magical pill to worker 0.
- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 5 >= 5)

Example 3:

Input: tasks = [10,15,30], workers = [0,10,10,10,10], pills = 3, strength = 10

- Assign worker 0 to task 0 (0 + 10 >= 10)
- Assign worker 1 to task 1 (10 + 10 >= 15)

```","There is an 8 x 8 chessboard containing n pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array pieces of length n, where pieces[i] describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the ith piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array positions also of length n, where positions[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that the ith piece is currently at the 1-based coordinate (ri, ci) on the chessboard.
When making a move for a piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.

A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1).
A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
A bishop can only travel diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).

You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the 0th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given time, two or more pieces occupy the same square.
Return the number of valid move combinations​​​​​.
Notes:

No two pieces will start in the same square.
You may choose the square a piece is already on as its destination.
If two pieces are directly adjacent to each other, it is valid for them to move past each other and swap positions in one second.

The roads are represented as a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [xi, yi, timei] denotes a road between cities xi and yi that takes timei minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.
Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a 0-indexed integer array passingFees of length n where passingFees[j] is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city j.

```","There is a tournament where n players are participating. The players are standing in a single row and are numbered from 1 to n based on their initial standing position (player 1 is the first player in the row, player 2 is the second player in the row, etc.).
The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Player 1 competes against player 7.
Player 2 competes against player 6.
Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.



After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).
The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.

```","You have a movie renting company consisting of n shops. You want to implement a renting system that supports searching for, booking, and returning movies. The system should also support generating a report of the currently rented movies.
Each movie is given as a 2D integer array entries where entries[i] = [shopi, moviei, pricei] indicates that there is a copy of movie moviei at shop shopi with a rental price of pricei. Each shop carries at most one copy of a movie moviei.
The system should support the following functions:

Search: Finds the cheapest 5 shops that have an unrented copy of a given movie. The shops should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopi should appear first. If there are less than 5 matching shops, then all of them should be returned. If no shop has an unrented copy, then an empty list should be returned.
Rent: Rents an unrented copy of a given movie from a given shop.
Drop: Drops off a previously rented copy of a given movie at a given shop.
Report: Returns the cheapest 5 rented movies (possibly of the same movie ID) as a 2D list res where res[j] = [shopj, moviej] describes that the jth cheapest rented movie moviej was rented from the shop shopj. The movies in res should be sorted by price in ascending order, and in case of a tie, the one with the smaller shopj should appear first, and if there is still tie, the one with the smaller moviej should appear first. If there are fewer than 5 rented movies, then all of them should be returned. If no movies are currently being rented, then an empty list should be returned.

Implement the MovieRentingSystem class:

void rent(int shop, int movie) Rents the given movie from the given shop.
void drop(int shop, int movie) Drops off a previously rented movie at the given shop.
List<List<Integer>> report() Returns a list of cheapest rented movies as described above.

```","You are given an integer hoursBefore, the number of hours you have to travel to your meeting. To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.
After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.

For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly 2 hours, you do not need to wait.

However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.

For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.

Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.
 
Example 1:

Input: dist = [1,3,2], speed = 4, hoursBefore = 2
Output: 1
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (1/4 + 3/4) + (3/4 + 1/4) + (2/4) = 2.5 hours.
You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.
Note that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.

Example 2:

Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) + (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.
You can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) + ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.

Example 3:

Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 1, hoursBefore = 10
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to arrive at the meeting on time even if you skip all the rests.

n == dist.length
1 <= n <= 1000
1 <= dist[i] <= 105
1 <= speed <= 106

```","You are given two integers, m and k, and a stream of integers. You are tasked to implement a data structure that calculates the MKAverage for the stream.
The MKAverage can be calculated using these steps:

If the number of the elements in the stream is less than m you should consider the MKAverage to be -1. Otherwise, copy the last m elements of the stream to a separate container.
Remove the smallest k elements and the largest k elements from the container.
Calculate the average value for the rest of the elements rounded down to the nearest integer.

Implement the MKAverage class:

MKAverage(int m, int k) Initializes the MKAverage object with an empty stream and the two integers m and k.
void addElement(int num) Inserts a new element num into the stream.
int calculateMKAverage() Calculates and returns the MKAverage for the current stream rounded down to the nearest integer.

Output
[null, null, null, -1, null, 3, null, null, null, 5]

Explanation
MKAverage obj = new MKAverage(3, 1);

obj.addElement(10);       // current elements are [3,1,10]
obj.calculateMKAverage(); // The last 3 elements are [3,1,10].
                          // After removing smallest and largest 1 element the container will be [3].
                          // The average of [3] equals 3/1 = 3, return 3
obj.addElement(5);        // current elements are [3,1,10,5]

```","You are given four integers, m, n, introvertsCount, and extrovertsCount. You have an m x n grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are introvertsCount introverts and extrovertsCount extroverts.
You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.
The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:

Introverts start with 120 happiness and lose 30 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
Extroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.
The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.
 
Example 1:


Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

Example 3:

Input: m = 2, n = 2, introvertsCount = 4, extrovertsCount = 0
Output: 240

 
Constraints:

1 <= m, n <= 5
0 <= introvertsCount, extrovertsCount <= min(m * n, 6)

Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).
Return the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
 
Example 1:

Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1

Example 2:

Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

Example 3:

Input: balls = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.
Probability = 108 / 180 = 0.6

 
Constraints:

1 <= balls.length <= 8
1 <= balls[i] <= 6
