largest-number-after-digit-swaps-by-parity,"You are given a positive integer num. You may swap any two digits of num that have the same parity (i.e. both odd digits or both even digits).
Return the largest possible value of num after any number of swaps.
??
Example 1:

Input: num = 1234
Output: 3412
Explanation: Swap the digit 3 with the digit 1, this results in the number 3214.
Swap the digit 2 with the digit 4, this results in the number 3412.
Note that there may be other sequences of swaps but it can be shown that 3412 is the largest possible number.
Also note that we may not swap the digit 4 with the digit 1 since they are of different parities.

Example 2:

Input: num = 65875
Output: 87655
Explanation: Swap the digit 8 with the digit 6, this results in the number 85675.

You are also given a 2D array queries of size m where queries[i] = [indexi, ki].
Initially all elements of the array are unmarked.
You need to apply m queries on the array in order, where on the ith query you do the following:

Mark the element at index indexi if it is not already marked.
Then mark ki unmarked elements in the array with the smallest values. If multiple such elements exist, mark the ones with the smallest indices. And if less than ki unmarked elements exist, then mark all of them.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the sum of unmarked elements in the array after the ith query.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1], queries = [[1,2],[3,3],[4,2]]
Output: [8,3,0]
Explanation:
We do the following queries on the array:

Mark the element at index 1, and 2 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices if they exist, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 2 + 2 + 3 + 1 = 8.
Mark the element at index 3, since it is already marked we skip it. Then we mark 3 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 3.
Mark the element at index 4, since it is already marked we skip it. Then we mark 2 of the smallest unmarked elements with the smallest indices if they exist, the marked elements now are nums = [1,2,2,1,2,3,1]. The sum of unmarked elements is 0.


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,4,2,3], queries = [[0,1]]
Output: [7]
Explanation:  We do one query which is mark the element at index 0 and mark the smallest element among unmarked elements. The marked elements will be nums = [1,4,2,3], and the sum of unmarked elements is 4 + 3 = 7.

string-compression-ii,"Run-length encoding is a string compression method that works by??replacing consecutive identical characters (repeated 2 or more times) with the concatenation of the character and the number marking the count of the characters (length of the run). For example, to compress the string??""aabccc""??we replace ""aa""??by??""a2""??and replace ""ccc""??by??""c3"". Thus the compressed string becomes ""a2bc3"".
Notice that in this problem, we are not adding??'1'??after single characters.
Given a??string s??and an integer k. You need to delete at most??k characters from??s??such that the run-length encoded version of s??has minimum length.
Find the minimum length of the run-length encoded??version of s after deleting at most k characters.
??
Example 1:

Input: s = ""aaabcccd"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: Compressing s without deleting anything will give us ""a3bc3d"" of length 6. Deleting any of the characters 'a' or 'c' would at most decrease the length of the compressed string to 5, for instance delete 2 'a' then we will have s = ""abcccd"" which compressed is abc3d. Therefore, the optimal way is to delete 'b' and 'd', then the compressed version of s will be ""a3c3"" of length 4.
Example 2:

Input: s = ""aabbaa"", k = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: If we delete both 'b' characters, the resulting compressed string would be ""a4"" of length 2.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""aaaaaaaaaaa"", k = 0

distribute-elements-into-two-arrays-ii,"You are given a 1-indexed array of integers nums of length n.
We define a function greaterCount such that greaterCount(arr, val) returns the number of elements in arr that are strictly greater than val.
You need to distribute all the elements of nums between two arrays arr1 and arr2 using n operations. In the first operation, append nums[1] to arr1. In the second operation, append nums[2] to arr2. Afterwards, in the ith operation:

If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) > greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to arr1.

If greaterCount(arr1, nums[i]) == greaterCount(arr2, nums[i]), append nums[i] to the array with a lesser number of elements.
If there is still a tie, append nums[i] to arr1.

In the 4th operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is zero in both arrays. As the length of arr2 is lesser, hence, append nums[4] to arr2.
After 4 operations, arr1 = [2,3] and arr2 = [1,3].
Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [2,3,1,3].

Input: nums = [5,14,3,1,2]
Output: [5,3,1,2,14]
Explanation: After the first 2 operations, arr1 = [5] and arr2 = [14].
In the 3rd operation, the number of elements greater than 3 is one in both arrays. Also, the lengths are equal, hence, append nums[3] to arr1.
In the 4th operation, the number of elements greater than 1 is greater in arr1 than arr2 (2 > 1). Hence, append nums[4] to arr1.
In the 5th operation, the number of elements greater than 2 is greater in arr1 than arr2 (2 > 1). Hence, append nums[5] to arr1.
After 5 operations, arr1 = [5,3,1,2] and arr2 = [14].
Hence, the array result formed by concatenation is [5,3,1,2,14].

The substrings do not overlap, that is for any two substrings s[i..j] and s[x..y], either j < x or i > y is true.
A substring that contains a certain character c must also contain all occurrences of c.

Find the maximum number of substrings that meet the above conditions. If there are multiple solutions with the same number of substrings, return the one with minimum total length. It can be shown that there exists a unique solution of minimum total length.
Notice that you can return the substrings in any order.

[
?? ""adefaddaccc""
?? ""adefadda"",
?? ""ef"",
?? ""e"",
  ""f"",
?? ""ccc"",

If we choose the first string, we cannot choose anything else and we'd get only 1. If we choose ""adefadda"", we are left with ""ccc"" which is the only one that doesn't overlap, thus obtaining 2 substrings. Notice also, that it's not optimal to choose ""ef"" since it can be split into two. Therefore, the optimal way is to choose [""e"",""f"",""ccc""] which gives us 3 substrings. No other solution of the same number of substrings exist.

maximum-number-of-operations-with-the-same-score-ii,"Given an array of integers called nums, you can perform any of the following operation while nums contains at least 2 elements:

Choose the first two elements of nums and delete them.
Choose the last two elements of nums and delete them.
Choose the first and the last elements of nums and delete them.

The score of the operation is the sum of the deleted elements.
Your task is to find the maximum number of operations that can be performed, such that all operations have the same score.
Return the maximum number of operations possible that satisfy the condition mentioned above.

- Delete the first two elements, with score 3 + 2 = 5, nums = [1,2,3,4].
- Delete the first and the last elements, with score 1 + 4 = 5, nums = [2,3].
- Delete the first and the last elements, with score 2 + 3 = 5, nums = [].

Example 1:

Explanation:
For n = 15, powers = [1,2,4,8]. It can be shown that powers cannot be a smaller size.
Answer to 1st query: powers[0] * powers[1] = 1 * 2 = 2.
Answer to 2nd query: powers[2] = 4.

In the second operation: i = 1, p = 7, subtract 7 from nums[1], so nums becomes equal to [1,2,6,10].

longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-i,"You are given a string array words and a binary array groups both of length n, where words[i] is associated with groups[i].
Your task is to select the longest alternating subsequence from words. A subsequence of words is alternating if for any two consecutive strings in the sequence, their corresponding elements in the binary array groups differ. Essentially, you are to choose strings such that adjacent elements have non-matching corresponding bits in the groups array.
Formally, you need to find the longest subsequence of an array of indices [0, 1, ..., n - 1] denoted as [i0, i1, ..., ik-1], such that groups[ij] != groups[ij+1] for each 0 <= j < k - 1 and then find the words corresponding to these indices.
Return the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
Note: The elements in words are distinct.
??
Example 1:

Input: words = [""e"",""a"",""b""], groups = [0,0,1]
Output: [""e"",""b""]
Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [""e"",""b""] because groups[0] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is [""a"",""b""] because groups[1] != groups[2]. It can be demonstrated that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 2.

Example 2:

Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d""], groups = [1,0,1,1]
Output: [""a"",""b"",""c""]
Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [""a"",""b"",""c""] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[2]. Another subsequence that can be selected is [""a"",""b"",""d""] because groups[0] != groups[1] and groups[1] != groups[3]. It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the condition is 3.

minimum-number-of-pushes-to-type-word-ii,"You are given a string word containing lowercase English letters.
Telephone keypads have keys mapped with distinct collections of lowercase English letters, which can be used to form words by pushing them. For example, the key 2 is mapped with [""a"",""b"",""c""], we need to push the key one time to type ""a"", two times to type ""b"", and three times to type ""c"" .
It is allowed to remap the keys numbered 2 to 9 to distinct collections of letters. The keys can be remapped to any amount of letters, but each letter must be mapped to exactly one key. You need to find the minimum number of times the keys will be pushed to type the string word.
Return the minimum number of pushes needed to type word after remapping the keys.
An example mapping of letters to keys on a telephone keypad is given below. Note that 1, *, #, and 0 do not map to any letters.

??
Example 1:


Input: word = ""abcde""
Output: 5
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
""a"" -> one push on key 2
""b"" -> one push on key 3
""c"" -> one push on key 4
""d"" -> one push on key 5
""e"" -> one push on key 6
Total cost is 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5.
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.

Example 2:


Input: word = ""xyzxyzxyzxyz""
Output: 12
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
""x"" -> one push on key 2
""y"" -> one push on key 3
""z"" -> one push on key 4
Total cost is 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12
It can be shown that no other mapping can provide a lower cost.
Note that the key 9 is not mapped to any letter: it is not necessary to map letters to every key, but to map all the letters.

Example 3:


Input: word = ""aabbccddeeffgghhiiiiii""
Output: 24
Explanation: The remapped keypad given in the image provides the minimum cost.
""a"" -> one push on key 2
""b"" -> one push on key 3
""c"" -> one push on key 4
""d"" -> one push on key 5
""e"" -> one push on key 6
""f"" -> one push on key 7
""g"" -> one push on key 8
""h"" -> two pushes on key 9
""i"" -> one push on key 9
Total cost is 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 1 * 2 + 2 * 2 + 6 * 1 = 24.

You will run k sessions and hire exactly one worker in each session.
In each hiring session, choose the worker with the lowest cost from either the first candidates workers or the last candidates workers. Break the tie by the smallest index.
	
For example, if costs = [3,2,7,7,1,2] and candidates = 2, then in the first hiring session, we will choose the 4th worker because they have the lowest cost [3,2,7,7,1,2].

- In the second hiring round we choose the worker from [2,4,1]. The lowest cost is 1 (index 2). The total cost = 1 + 1 = 2.

For example, the XOR total of the array [2,5,6] is 2 XOR 5 XOR 6 = 1.

Given an array nums, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of nums.??
Note: Subsets with the same elements should be counted multiple times.
An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3]

Explanation: The 4 subsets of [1,3] are:
- The empty subset has an XOR total of 0.
- [1] has an XOR total of 1.
- [3] has an XOR total of 3.
- [1,3] has an XOR total of 1 XOR 3 = 2.

minimum-number-of-seconds-to-make-mountain-height-zero,"You are given an integer mountainHeight denoting the height of a mountain.
You are also given an integer array workerTimes representing the work time of workers in seconds.
The workers work simultaneously to reduce the height of the mountain. For worker i:

To decrease the mountain's height by x, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 + ... + workerTimes[i] * x seconds. For example:

	
To reduce the height of the mountain by 1, it takes workerTimes[i] seconds.
To reduce the height of the mountain by 2, it takes workerTimes[i] + workerTimes[i] * 2 seconds, and so on.



Return an integer representing the minimum number of seconds required for the workers to make the height of the mountain 0.
??
Example 1:

Input: mountainHeight = 4, workerTimes = [2,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation:
One way the height of the mountain can be reduced to 0 is:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[0] = 2 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 = 3 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 1, taking workerTimes[2] = 1 second.

Since they work simultaneously, the minimum time needed is max(2, 3, 1) = 3 seconds.

Example 2:

Input: mountainHeight = 10, workerTimes = [3,2,2,4]
Output: 12
Explanation:

Worker 0 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 = 9 seconds.
Worker 1 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[1] + workerTimes[1] * 2 + workerTimes[1] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 2 reduces the height by 3, taking workerTimes[2] + workerTimes[2] * 2 + workerTimes[2] * 3 = 12 seconds.
Worker 3 reduces the height by 2, taking workerTimes[3] + workerTimes[3] * 2 = 12 seconds.

The number of seconds needed is max(9, 12, 12, 12) = 12 seconds.

Example 3:

Input: mountainHeight = 5, workerTimes = [1]
Output: 15
Explanation:
There is only one worker in this example, so the answer is workerTimes[0] + workerTimes[0] * 2 + workerTimes[0] * 3 + workerTimes[0] * 4 + workerTimes[0] * 5 = 15.

- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 2 in the tree is 2, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 2 is still 2. So the answer for the first query is [2,2].
- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 5 in the tree is 4, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 5 is 6. So the answer for the second query is [4,6].
- The largest number that is smaller or equal than 16 in the tree is 15, and the smallest number that is greater or equal than 16 does not exist. So the answer for the third query is [15,-1].

most-popular-video-creator,"You are given two string arrays creators and ids, and an integer array views, all of length n. The ith video on a platform was created by creators[i], has an id of ids[i], and has views[i] views.
The popularity of a creator is the sum of the number of views on all of the creator's videos. Find the creator with the highest popularity and the id of their most viewed video.

If multiple creators have the highest popularity, find all of them.
If multiple videos have the highest view count for a creator, find the lexicographically smallest id.

Note: It is possible for different videos to have the same id, meaning that ids do not uniquely identify a video. For example, two videos with the same ID are considered as distinct videos with their own viewcount.
Return a 2D array of strings answer where answer[i] = [creatorsi, idi] means that creatorsi has the highest popularity and idi is the id of their most popular video. The answer can be returned in any order.

Input: creators = [""alice"",""bob"",""alice"",""chris""], ids = [""one"",""two"",""three"",""four""], views = [5,10,5,4]

Explanation:
The popularity of alice is 5 + 5 = 10.
The popularity of bob is 10.
The popularity of chris is 4.
alice and bob are the most popular creators.
For bob, the video with the highest view count is ""two"".
For alice, the videos with the highest view count are ""one"" and ""three"". Since ""one"" is lexicographically smaller than ""three"", it is included in the answer.

You are given an array edges of size n-1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] represents a bidirectional edge between cities ui and vi. There exists a unique path between each pair of cities. In other words, the cities form a tree.
A subtree is a subset of cities where every city is reachable from every other city in the subset, where the path between each pair passes through only the cities from the subset. Two subtrees are different if there is a city in one subtree that is not present in the other.
For each d from 1 to n-1, find the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities in the subtree is equal to d.
Return an array of size n-1 where the dth element (1-indexed) is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two cities is equal to d.

count-k-subsequences-of-a-string-with-maximum-beauty,"You are given a string s and an integer k.
A k-subsequence is a subsequence of s, having length k, and all its characters are unique, i.e., every character occurs once.
Let f(c) denote the number of times the character c occurs in s.
The beauty of a k-subsequence is the sum of f(c) for every character c in the k-subsequence.
For example, consider s = ""abbbdd"" and k = 2:

f('a') = 1, f('b') = 3, f('d') = 2
Some k-subsequences of s are:
	
""abbbdd"" -> ""ab"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') = 4
""abbbdd"" -> ""ad"" having a beauty of f('a') + f('d') = 3
""abbbdd"" -> ""bd"" having a beauty of f('b') + f('d') = 5



Return an integer denoting the number of k-subsequences whose beauty is the maximum among all k-subsequences. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A subsequence of a string is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
Notes

f(c) is the number of times a character c occurs in s, not a k-subsequence.
Two k-subsequences are considered different if one is formed by an index that is not present in the other. So, two k-subsequences may form the same string.

??
Example 1:

Input: s = ""bcca"", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 1, and f('c') = 2.
The k-subsequences of s are: 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('c') = 3 
bcca having a beauty of f('b') + f('a') = 2 
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3
bcca having a beauty of f('c') + f('a') = 3 
There are 4 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 3. 
Hence, the answer is 4. 

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbcd"", k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: From s we have f('a') = 1, f('b') = 2, f('c') = 1, and f('d') = 1. 
The k-subsequences of s are: 
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5
abbcd having a beauty of f('a') + f('b') + f('c') + f('d') = 5 
There are 2 k-subsequences that have the maximum beauty, 5. 
Hence, the answer is 2.

The rules of the game are as follows:
1st friend receives the ball.

After that, 1st friend passes it to the friend who is k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 2 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.
After that, the friend who receives the ball should pass it to the friend who is 3 * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction, and so on and so forth.

In other words, on the ith turn, the friend holding the ball should pass it to the friend who is i * k steps away from them in the clockwise direction.

Unfortunately, Alice lost all three arrays. However, she remembers the integers that were present in the arrays lower and higher, but not the array each integer belonged to. Help Alice and recover the original array.
Given an array nums consisting of 2n integers, where exactly n of the integers were present in lower and the remaining in higher, return the original array arr. In case the answer is not unique, return any valid array.

Explanation:
If arr = [3,7,11] and k = 1, we get lower = [2,6,10] and higher = [4,8,12].
Combining lower and higher gives us [2,6,10,4,8,12], which is a permutation of nums.

maximum-strength-of-k-disjoint-subarrays,"You are given an array of integers nums with length n, and a positive odd integer k.
Select exactly k disjoint subarrays sub1, sub2, ..., subk from nums such that the last element of subi appears before the first element of sub{i+1} for all 1 <= i <= k-1. The goal is to maximize their combined strength.
The strength of the selected subarrays is defined as:
strength = k * sum(sub1)- (k - 1) * sum(sub2) + (k - 2) * sum(sub3) - ... - 2 * sum(sub{k-1}) + sum(subk)
where sum(subi) is the sum of the elements in the i-th subarray.
Return the maximum possible strength that can be obtained from selecting exactly k disjoint subarrays from nums.
Note that the chosen subarrays don't need to cover the entire array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,-1,2], k = 3
Output: 22
Explanation:
The best possible way to select 3 subarrays is: nums[0..2], nums[3..3], and nums[4..4]. The strength is calculated as follows:
strength = 3 * (1 + 2 + 3) - 2 * (-1) + 2 = 22

count-tested-devices-after-test-operations,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array batteryPercentages having length n, denoting the battery percentages of n 0-indexed devices.
Your task is to test each device i in order from 0 to n - 1, by performing the following test operations:

If batteryPercentages[i] is greater than 0:

	
Increment the count of tested devices.
Decrease the battery percentage of all devices with indices j in the range [i + 1, n - 1] by 1, ensuring their battery percentage never goes below 0, i.e, batteryPercentages[j] = max(0, batteryPercentages[j] - 1).
Move to the next device.


Otherwise, move to the next device without performing any test.

Return an integer denoting the number of devices that will be tested after performing the test operations in order.
??
Example 1:

Input: batteryPercentages = [1,1,2,1,3]
Output: 3
Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:
At device 0, batteryPercentages[0] > 0, so there is now 1 tested device, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,2].
At device 1, batteryPercentages[1] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
At device 2, batteryPercentages[2] > 0, so there are now 2 tested devices, and batteryPercentages becomes [1,0,1,0,1].
At device 3, batteryPercentages[3] == 0, so we move to the next device without testing.
At device 4, batteryPercentages[4] > 0, so there are now 3 tested devices, and batteryPercentages stays the same.
So, the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: batteryPercentages = [0,1,2]

Explanation: Performing the test operations in order starting from device 0:

if the ith character is 'Y', it means that customers come at the ith hour
whereas 'N' indicates that no customers come at the ith hour.

If the shop closes at the jth hour (0 <= j <= n), the penalty is calculated as follows:

For every hour when the shop is open and no customers come, the penalty increases by 1.
For every hour when the shop is closed and customers come, the penalty increases by 1.

Return the earliest hour at which the shop must be closed to incur a minimum penalty.
Note that if a shop closes at the jth hour, it means the shop is closed at the hour j.

Example 1:

Explanation: 
- Closing the shop at the 0th hour incurs in 1+1+0+1 = 3 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 1st hour incurs in 0+1+0+1 = 2 penalty.
- Closing the shop at the 2nd hour incurs in 0+0+0+1 = 1 penalty.

check-if-an-original-string-exists-given-two-encoded-strings,"An original string, consisting of lowercase English letters, can be encoded by the following steps:

Arbitrarily split it into a sequence of some number of non-empty substrings.
Arbitrarily choose some elements (possibly none) of the sequence, and replace each with its length (as a numeric string).
Concatenate the sequence as the encoded string.

For example, one way to encode an original string ""abcdefghijklmnop"" might be:

Split it as a sequence: [""ab"", ""cdefghijklmn"", ""o"", ""p""].
Choose the second and third elements to be replaced by their lengths, respectively. The sequence becomes [""ab"", ""12"", ""1"", ""p""].
Concatenate the elements of the sequence to get the encoded string: ""ab121p"".

Given two encoded strings s1 and s2, consisting of lowercase English letters and digits 1-9 (inclusive), return true if there exists an original string that could be encoded as both s1 and s2. Otherwise, return false.
Note: The test cases are generated such that the number of consecutive digits in s1 and s2 does not exceed 3.
??
Example 1:

Input: s1 = ""internationalization"", s2 = ""i18n""
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that ""internationalization"" was the original string.
- ""internationalization"" 
  -> Split:       [""internationalization""]
  -> Do not replace any element
  -> Concatenate:  ""internationalization"", which is s1.
- ""internationalization""
  -> Split:       [""i"", ""nternationalizatio"", ""n""]
  -> Replace:     [""i"", ""18"",                 ""n""]
  -> Concatenate:  ""i18n"", which is s2

Example 2:

Input: s1 = ""l123e"", s2 = ""44""
Output: true
Explanation: It is possible that ""leetcode"" was the original string.
- ""leetcode"" 
  -> Split:      [""l"", ""e"", ""et"", ""cod"", ""e""]
  -> Replace:    [""l"", ""1"", ""2"",  ""3"",   ""e""]
  -> Concatenate: ""l123e"", which is s1.
- ""leetcode"" 
  -> Split:      [""leet"", ""code""]
  -> Replace:    [""4"",    ""4""]
  -> Concatenate: ""44"", which is s2.

Example 3:

Input: s1 = ""a5b"", s2 = ""c5b""
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible.
- The original string encoded as s1 must start with the letter 'a'.
- The original string encoded as s2 must start with the letter 'c'.

second-minimum-time-to-reach-destination,"A city is represented as a bi-directional connected graph with n vertices where each vertex is labeled from 1 to n (inclusive). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex ui and vertex vi. Every vertex pair is connected by at most one edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself. The time taken to traverse any edge is time minutes.
Each vertex has a traffic signal which changes its color from green to red and vice versa every??change minutes. All signals change at the same time. You can enter a vertex at any time, but can leave a vertex only when the signal is green. You cannot wait at a vertex if the signal is green.
The second minimum value is defined as the smallest value strictly larger than the minimum value.

For example the second minimum value of [2, 3, 4] is 3, and the second minimum value of [2, 2, 4] is 4.

Given n, edges, time, and change, return the second minimum time it will take to go from vertex 1 to vertex n.
Notes:

You can go through any vertex any number of times, including 1 and n.
You can assume that when the journey starts, all signals have just turned green.

Output: 13
Explanation:
The figure on the left shows the given graph.
The blue path in the figure on the right is the minimum time path.
The time taken is:
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
Hence the minimum time needed is 6 minutes.

The red path shows the path to get the second minimum time.
- Start at 1, time elapsed=0
- 1 -> 3: 3 minutes, time elapsed=3
- 3 -> 4: 3 minutes, time elapsed=6
- Wait at 4 for 4 minutes, time elapsed=10
- 4 -> 5: 3 minutes, time elapsed=13
Hence the second minimum time is 13 minutes.

For example if n = 3 and two employees are leaving building 0, one is leaving building 1, and one is leaving building 2, there should be two employees moving to building 0, one employee moving to building 1, and one employee moving to building 2.
Return the maximum number of achievable requests.

Example 1:


Input: n = 5, requests = [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]
Output: 5

From building 0 we have employees x and y and both want to move to building 1.
From building 1 we have employees a and b and they want to move to buildings 2 and 0 respectively.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 0.
From building 3 we have employee c and they want to move to building 4.
From building 4 we don't have any requests.
We can achieve the requests of users x and b by swapping their places.
We can achieve the requests of users y, a and z by swapping the places in the 3 buildings.

Example 2:


Input: n = 3, requests = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,1]]

Explantion: Let's see the requests:
From building 0 we have employee x and they want to stay in the same building 0.
From building 1 we have employee y and they want to move to building 2.
From building 2 we have employee z and they want to move to building 1.
We can achieve all the requests.

Explanation: We can split the array at index 2 to obtain arrays [1,2,2] and [2]. 
In array [1,2,2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs twice in the array and 2 * 2 > 3. 
In array [2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs once in the array and 1 * 2 > 1.
Both [1,2,2] and [2] have the same dominant element as nums, so this is a valid split. 
It can be shown that index 2 is the minimum index of a valid split. 
Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1,3,1,1,1,7,1,2,1]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can split the array at index 4 to obtain arrays [2,1,3,1,1] and [1,7,1,2,1].
In array [2,1,3,1,1], element 1 is dominant since it occurs thrice in the array and 3 * 2 > 5.
In array [1,7,1,2,1], element 1 is dominant since it occurs thrice in the array and 3 * 2 > 5.
Both [2,1,3,1,1] and [1,7,1,2,1] have the same dominant element as nums, so this is a valid split.
It can be shown that index 4 is the minimum index of a valid split.
Example 3:

number-of-possible-sets-of-closing-branches,"There is a company with n branches across the country, some of which are connected by roads. Initially, all branches are reachable from each other by traveling some roads.
The company has realized that they are spending an excessive amount of time traveling between their branches. As a result, they have decided to close down some of these branches (possibly none). However, they want to ensure that the remaining branches have a distance of at most maxDistance from each other.
The distance between two branches is the minimum total traveled length needed to reach one branch from another.
You are given integers n, maxDistance, and a 0-indexed 2D array roads, where roads[i] = [ui, vi, wi] represents the undirected road between branches ui and vi with length wi.
Return the number of possible sets of closing branches, so that any branch has a distance of at most maxDistance from any other.
Note that, after closing a branch, the company will no longer have access to any roads connected to it.
Note that, multiple roads are allowed.
??
Example 1:


Input: n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,2],[1,2,10],[0,2,10]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
- The set [2], after closing, active branches are [0,1] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
- The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].
- The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].
- The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].
- The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.
It can be proven, that there are only 5 possible sets of closing branches.

Example 2:


Input: n = 3, maxDistance = 5, roads = [[0,1,20],[0,1,10],[1,2,2],[0,2,2]]
Output: 7
Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
- The set [], after closing, active branches are [0,1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 4.
- The set [0], after closing, active branches are [1,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
- The set [1], after closing, active branches are [0,2] and they are reachable to each other within distance 2.
- The set [0,1], after closing, the active branch is [2].
- The set [1,2], after closing, the active branch is [0].
- The set [0,2], after closing, the active branch is [1].
- The set [0,1,2], after closing, there are no active branches.
It can be proven, that there are only 7 possible sets of closing branches.

Example 3:

Input: n = 1, maxDistance = 10, roads = []
Output: 2
Explanation: The possible sets of closing branches are:
- The set [], after closing, the active branch is [0].

minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-k-increasing,"You are given a 0-indexed array arr consisting of n positive integers, and a positive integer k.
The array arr is called K-increasing if arr[i-k] <= arr[i] holds for every index i, where k <= i <= n-1.

For example, arr = [4, 1, 5, 2, 6, 2] is K-increasing for k = 2 because:

	
arr[0] <= arr[2] (4 <= 5)
arr[1] <= arr[3] (1 <= 2)
arr[2] <= arr[4] (5 <= 6)
arr[3] <= arr[5] (2 <= 2)


However, the same arr is not K-increasing for k = 1 (because arr[0] > arr[1]) or k = 3 (because arr[0] > arr[3]).

In one operation, you can choose an index i and change arr[i] into any positive integer.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the array K-increasing for the given k.
??
Example 1:

Input: arr = [5,4,3,2,1], k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
For k = 1, the resultant array has to be non-decreasing.
Some of the K-increasing arrays that can be formed are [5,6,7,8,9], [1,1,1,1,1], [2,2,3,4,4]. All of them require 4 operations.
It is suboptimal to change the array to, for example, [6,7,8,9,10] because it would take 5 operations.
It can be shown that we cannot make the array K-increasing in less than 4 operations.

Example 2:

Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation:
This is the same example as the one in the problem description.
Here, for every index i where 2 <= i <= 5, arr[i-2] <= arr[i].
Since the given array is already K-increasing, we do not need to perform any operations.
Example 3:

Input: arr = [4,1,5,2,6,2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
Indices 3 and 5 are the only ones not satisfying arr[i-3] <= arr[i] for 3 <= i <= 5.
One of the ways we can make the array K-increasing is by changing arr[3] to 4 and arr[5] to 5.
The array will now be [4,1,5,4,6,5].
Note that there can be other ways to make the array K-increasing, but none of them require less than 2 operations.

defuse-the-bomb,"You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code??of length of n??and a key k.
To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.

As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].
Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!
??
Example 1:

Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.

Example 2:

Input: code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation: When k is zero, the numbers are replaced by 0. 

Example 3:

Input: code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2
Output: [12,5,6,13]
Explanation: The decrypted code is [3+9, 2+3, 4+2, 9+4]. Notice that the numbers wrap around again. If k is negative, the sum is of the previous numbers.

count-subarrays-with-score-less-than-k,"The score of an array is defined as the product of its sum and its length.

For example, the score of [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] is (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5) * 5 = 75.

Given a positive integer array nums and an integer k, return the number of non-empty subarrays of nums whose score is strictly less than k.
A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10
Output: 6
Explanation:
The 6 subarrays having scores less than 10 are:
- [2] with score 2 * 1 = 2.
- [1] with score 1 * 1 = 1.
- [4] with score 4 * 1 = 4.
- [3] with score 3 * 1 = 3. 
- [5] with score 5 * 1 = 5.
- [2,1] with score (2 + 1) * 2 = 6.
Note that subarrays such as [1,4] and [4,3,5] are not considered because their scores are 10 and 36 respectively, while we need scores strictly less than 10.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation:
Every subarray except [1,1,1] has a score less than 5.
[1,1,1] has a score (1 + 1 + 1) * 3 = 9, which is greater than 5.
Thus, there are 5 subarrays having scores less than 5.

Example 1:

Input:   nums = [1,2,3], k = 3 
Output:   6 
Explanation:
There are 5 subsequences of nums with non-zero power:

The subsequence [1,2,3] has 2 subsequences with sum == 3: [1,2,3] and [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].
The subsequence [1,2,3] has 1 subsequence with sum == 3: [1,2,3].

Select a path from them and append digits in this path to the number being formed by traveling in this direction.
Note that numbers are generated at every step, for example, if the digits along the path are 1, 9, 1, then there will be three numbers generated along the way: 1, 19, 191.

find-the-length-of-the-longest-common-prefix,"You are given two arrays with positive integers arr1 and arr2.
A prefix of a positive integer is an integer formed by one or more of its digits, starting from its leftmost digit. For example, 123 is a prefix of the integer 12345, while 234 is not.
A common prefix of two integers a and b is an integer c, such that c is a prefix of both a and b. For example, 5655359 and 56554 have common prefixes 565 and 5655 while 1223 and 43456 do not have a common prefix.
You need to find the length of the longest common prefix between all pairs of integers (x, y) such that x belongs to arr1 and y belongs to arr2.
Return the length of the longest common prefix among all pairs. If no common prefix exists among them, return 0.
??
Example 1:

Input: arr1 = [1,10,100], arr2 = [1000]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 pairs (arr1[i], arr2[j]):
- The longest common prefix of (1, 1000) is 1.
- The longest common prefix of (10, 1000) is 10.
- The longest common prefix of (100, 1000) is 100.
The longest common prefix is 100 with a length of 3.

Example 2:

Input: arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [4,4,4]

Explanation: There exists no common prefix for any pair (arr1[i], arr2[j]), hence we return 0.

find-all-k-distant-indices-in-an-array,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and two integers key and k. A k-distant index is an index i of nums for which there exists at least one index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key.
Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,4,9,1,3,9,5], key = 9, k = 1
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Explanation: Here, nums[2] == key and nums[5] == key.
- For index 0, |0 - 2| > k and |0 - 5| > k, so there is no j where |0 - j| <= k and nums[j] == key. Thus, 0 is not a k-distant index.
- For index 1, |1 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 1 is a k-distant index.
- For index 2, |2 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 2 is a k-distant index.
- For index 3, |3 - 2| <= k and nums[2] == key, so 3 is a k-distant index.
- For index 4, |4 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 4 is a k-distant index.
- For index 5, |5 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 5 is a k-distant index.
- For index 6, |6 - 5| <= k and nums[5] == key, so 6 is a k-distant index.
Thus, we return [1,2,3,4,5,6] which is sorted in increasing order. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,2,2,2], key = 2, k = 2
Output: [0,1,2,3,4]
Explanation: For all indices i in nums, there exists some index j such that |i - j| <= k and nums[j] == key, so every index is a k-distant index. 
Hence, we return [0,1,2,3,4].

For each position i that you visit, you get a score of nums[i].
If you move from a position i to a position j and the parities of nums[i] and nums[j] differ, then you lose a score of x.

Explanation: We can visit the following positions in the array: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4.
The corresponding values are 2, 6, 1 and 9. Since the integers 6 and 1 have different parities, the move 2 -> 3 will make you lose a score of x = 5.

Between every pair of adjacent nodes, insert a new node with a value equal to the greatest common divisor of them.
Return the linked list after insertion.
The greatest common divisor of two numbers is the largest positive integer that evenly divides both numbers.
??
Example 1:


Input: head = [18,6,10,3]
Output: [18,6,6,2,10,1,3]
Explanation: The 1st diagram denotes the initial linked list and the 2nd diagram denotes the linked list after inserting the new nodes (nodes in blue are the inserted nodes).
- We insert the greatest common divisor of 18 and 6 = 6 between the 1st and the 2nd nodes.
- We insert the greatest common divisor of 6 and 10 = 2 between the 2nd and the 3rd nodes.
- We insert the greatest common divisor of 10 and 3 = 1 between the 3rd and the 4th nodes.
There are no more adjacent nodes, so we return the linked list.

Note that all the elements get replaced simultaneously.

Example 1:

- At 1st second, replace values at each index with [nums[3],nums[1],nums[3],nums[3]]. After replacement, nums = [2,2,2,2].
It can be proven that 1 second is the minimum amount of seconds needed for equalizing the array.

Example 2:

the-score-of-students-solving-math-expression,"You are given a string s that contains digits 0-9, addition symbols '+', and multiplication symbols '*' only, representing a valid math expression of single digit numbers (e.g., 3+5*2). This expression was given to n elementary school students. The students were instructed to get the answer of the expression by following this order of operations:

Compute multiplication, reading from left to right; Then,
Compute addition, reading from left to right.

You are given an integer array answers of length n, which are the submitted answers of the students in no particular order. You are asked to grade the answers, by following these rules:

If an answer equals the correct answer of the expression, this student will be rewarded 5 points;
Otherwise, if the answer could be interpreted as if the student applied the operators in the wrong order but had correct arithmetic, this student will be rewarded 2 points;
Otherwise, this student will be rewarded 0 points.

Return the sum of the points of the students.
??
Example 1:


Input: s = ""7+3*1*2"", answers = [20,13,42]
Output: 7
Explanation: As illustrated above, the correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore one student is rewarded 5 points: [20,13,42]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((7+3)*1)*2 = 20. Therefore one student is rewarded 2 points: [20,13,42]
The points for the students are: [2,5,0]. The sum of the points is 2+5+0=7.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""3+5*2"", answers = [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
Output: 19
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 13, therefore three students are rewarded 5 points each: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
A student might have applied the operators in this wrong order: ((3+5)*2 = 16. Therefore two students are rewarded 2 points: [13,0,10,13,13,16,16]
The points for the students are: [5,0,0,5,5,2,2]. The sum of the points is 5+0+0+5+5+2+2=19.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""6+0*1"", answers = [12,9,6,4,8,6]
Output: 10
Explanation: The correct answer of the expression is 6.
If a student had incorrectly done (6+0)*1, the answer would also be 6.
By the rules of grading, the students will still be rewarded 5 points (as they got the correct answer), not 2 points.
The points for the students are: [0,0,5,0,0,5]. The sum of the points is 10.

Pick two different unmarked indices i and j such that 2 * nums[i] <= nums[j], then mark i and j.

Return the maximum possible number of marked indices in nums using the above operation any number of times.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,2,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: In the first operation: pick i = 2 and j = 1, the operation is allowed because 2 * nums[2] <= nums[1]. Then mark index 2 and 1.
It can be shown that there's no other valid operation so the answer is 2.

Example 2:

high-access-employees,"You are given a 2D 0-indexed array of strings, access_times, with size n. For each i where 0 <= i <= n - 1, access_times[i][0] represents the name of an employee, and access_times[i][1] represents the access time of that employee. All entries in access_times are within the same day.
The access time is represented as four digits using a 24-hour time format, for example, ""0800"" or ""2250"".
An employee is said to be high-access if he has accessed the system three or more times within a one-hour period.
Times with exactly one hour of difference are not considered part of the same one-hour period. For example, ""0815"" and ""0915"" are not part of the same one-hour period.
Access times at the start and end of the day are not counted within the same one-hour period. For example, ""0005"" and ""2350"" are not part of the same one-hour period.
Return a list that contains the names of high-access employees with any order you want.

Output: [""a""]
Explanation: ""a"" has three access times in the one-hour period of [05:32, 06:31] which are 05:32, 05:49, and 06:21.
But ""b"" does not have more than two access times at all.

Output: [""c"",""d""]
Explanation: ""c"" has three access times in the one-hour period of [08:08, 09:07] which are 08:08, 08:09, and 08:29.
""d"" has also three access times in the one-hour period of [14:10, 15:09] which are 14:10, 14:44, and 15:08.
However, ""e"" has just one access time, so it can not be in the answer and the final answer is [""c"",""d""].

Explanation: ""ab"" has three access times in the one-hour period of [10:25, 11:24] which are 10:25, 11:20, and 11:24.
""cd"" has also three access times in the one-hour period of [10:25, 11:24] which are 10:25, 10:46, and 10:55.

??
Example 1:

Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,1]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[6,6]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 1. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.
Example 2:

Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[1,3],[1,5]], topRight = [[5,5],[5,7],[5,9]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
A square with side length 2 can fit inside either the intersecting region of rectangles 0 and 1 or the intersecting region of rectangles 1 and 2. Hence the maximum area is 2 * 2 = 4. It can be shown that a square with a greater side length can not fit inside any intersecting region of two rectangles.
Example 3:
  
Input: bottomLeft = [[1,1],[2,2],[1,2]], topRight = [[3,3],[4,4],[3,4]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
A square with side length 1 can fit inside the intersecting region of any two rectangles. Also, no larger square can, so the maximum area is 1. Note that the region can be formed by the intersection of more than 2 rectangles.
Example 4:

You are given a 2D integer array meetings where meetings[i] = [starti, endi] means that a meeting will be held during the half-closed time interval [starti, endi). All the values of starti are unique.
Meetings are allocated to rooms in the following manner:

Each meeting will take place in the unused room with the lowest number.
If there are no available rooms, the meeting will be delayed until a room becomes free. The delayed meeting should have the same duration as the original meeting.
When a room becomes unused, meetings that have an earlier original start time should be given the room.

Return the number of the room that held the most meetings. If there are multiple rooms, return the room with the lowest number.
A half-closed interval [a, b) is the interval between a and b including a and not including b.

Example 1:

Input: n = 2, meetings = [[0,10],[1,5],[2,7],[3,4]]

Explanation:
- At time 0, both rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 1, only room 1 is not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 2, both rooms are being used. The third meeting is delayed.

- At time 10, the meetings in both rooms finish. The fourth meeting starts in room 0 for the time period [10,11).
Both rooms 0 and 1 held 2 meetings, so we return 0. 

Example 2:

Input: n = 3, meetings = [[1,20],[2,10],[3,5],[4,9],[6,8]]
Output: 1
Explanation:
- At time 1, all three rooms are not being used. The first meeting starts in room 0.
- At time 2, rooms 1 and 2 are not being used. The second meeting starts in room 1.
- At time 3, only room 2 is not being used. The third meeting starts in room 2.
- At time 4, all three rooms are being used. The fourth meeting is delayed.
- At time 5, the meeting in room 2 finishes. The fourth meeting starts in room 2 for the time period [5,10).
- At time 6, all three rooms are being used. The fifth meeting is delayed.
- At time 10, the meetings in rooms 1 and 2 finish. The fifth meeting starts in room 1 for the time period [10,12).
Room 0 held 1 meeting while rooms 1 and 2 each held 2 meetings, so we return 1.

If the character is not in the string chars, then its value is its corresponding position (1-indexed) in the alphabet.

	
For example, the value of 'a' is 1, the value of 'b' is 2, and so on. The value of 'z' is 26.


Otherwise, assuming i is the index where the character occurs in the string chars, then its value is vals[i].

Note that:

A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same node, and each edge in the path is visited only once.
The length of a cycle is the number of edges visited in the cycle.

minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-word-k-periodic,"You are given a string word of size n, and an integer k such that k divides n.
In one operation, you can pick any two indices i and j, that are divisible by k, then replace the substring of length k starting at i with the substring of length k starting at j. That is, replace the substring word[i..i + k - 1] with the substring word[j..j + k - 1].
Return the minimum number of operations required to make word k-periodic.
We say that word is k-periodic if there is some string s of length k such that word can be obtained by concatenating s an arbitrary number of times. For example, if word == ???????ababab???????, then word is 2-periodic for s = ""ab"".

Example 1:

Input: word = ""leetcodeleet"", k = 4

Explanation:
We can obtain a 4-periodic string by picking i = 4 and j = 0. After this operation, word becomes equal to ""leetleetleet"".

longest-unequal-adjacent-groups-subsequence-ii,"You are given a string array words, and an array groups, both arrays having length n.
The hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.
You need to select the longest subsequence from an array of indices [0, 1, ..., n - 1], such that for the subsequence denoted as [i0, i1, ..., ik-1] having length k, the following holds:

For adjacent indices in the subsequence, their corresponding groups are unequal, i.e., groups[ij] != groups[ij+1], for each j where 0 < j + 1 < k.
words[ij] and words[ij+1] are equal in length, and the hamming distance between them is 1, where 0 < j + 1 < k, for all indices in the subsequence.

Return a string array containing the words corresponding to the indices (in order) in the selected subsequence. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.
Note: strings in words may be unequal in length.
??
Example 1:

Input: words = [""bab"",""dab"",""cab""], groups = [1,2,2]
Output: [""bab"",""cab""]
Explanation: A subsequence that can be selected is [0,2].

groups[0] != groups[2]
words[0].length == words[2].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.

So, a valid answer is [words[0],words[2]] = [""bab"",""cab""].
Another subsequence that can be selected is [0,1].

groups[0] != groups[1]
words[0].length == words[1].length, and the hamming distance between them is 1.

So, another valid answer is [words[0],words[1]] = [""bab"",""dab""].
It can be shown that the length of the longest subsequence of indices that satisfies the conditions is 2.

Example 2:

Input: words = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d""], groups = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d""]
Explanation: We can select the subsequence [0,1,2,3].
It satisfies both conditions.
Hence, the answer is [words[0],words[1],words[2],words[3]] = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""d""].
It has the longest length among all subsequences of indices that satisfy the conditions.

cat-and-mouse-ii,"A game is played by a cat and a mouse named Cat and Mouse.
The environment is represented by a grid of size rows x cols, where each element is a wall, floor, player (Cat, Mouse), or food.

Players are represented by the characters 'C'(Cat),'M'(Mouse).
Floors are represented by the character '.' and can be walked on.
Walls are represented by the character '#' and cannot be walked on.
Food is represented by the character 'F' and can be walked on.
There is only one of each character 'C', 'M', and 'F' in grid.

Mouse and Cat play according to the following rules:

Mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.
During each turn, Cat and Mouse can jump in one of the four directions (left, right, up, down). They cannot jump over the wall nor outside of the grid.
catJump, mouseJump are the maximum lengths Cat and Mouse can jump at a time, respectively. Cat and Mouse can jump less than the maximum length.
Staying in the same position is allowed.
Mouse can jump over Cat.

The game can end in 4 ways:

If Cat occupies the same position as Mouse, Cat wins.
If Cat reaches the food first, Cat wins.
If Mouse reaches the food first, Mouse wins.
If Mouse cannot get to the food within 1000 turns, Cat wins.

Given a rows x cols matrix grid and two integers catJump and mouseJump, return true if Mouse can win the game if both Cat and Mouse play optimally, otherwise return false.

Example 1:


Input: grid = [""####F"",""#C..."",""M....""], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 2
Output: true
Explanation: Cat cannot catch Mouse on its turn nor can it get the food before Mouse.

Example 2:


Input: grid = [""M.C...F""], catJump = 1, mouseJump = 4

2. Choose i = 3, and nums becomes [4,6,2,5].
3. Choose i = 1, and nums becomes [5,5,2,5].

maximum-number-of-robots-within-budget,"You have n robots. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, chargeTimes and runningCosts, both of length n. The ith robot costs chargeTimes[i] units to charge and costs runningCosts[i] units to run. You are also given an integer budget.
The total cost of running k chosen robots is equal to max(chargeTimes) + k * sum(runningCosts), where max(chargeTimes) is the largest charge cost among the k robots and sum(runningCosts) is the sum of running costs among the k robots.
Return the maximum number of consecutive robots you can run such that the total cost does not exceed budget.
??
Example 1:

Input: chargeTimes = [3,6,1,3,4], runningCosts = [2,1,3,4,5], budget = 25
Output: 3
Explanation: 
It is possible to run all individual and consecutive pairs of robots within budget.
To obtain answer 3, consider the first 3 robots. The total cost will be max(3,6,1) + 3 * sum(2,1,3) = 6 + 3 * 6 = 24 which is less than 25.
It can be shown that it is not possible to run more than 3 consecutive robots within budget, so we return 3.

Example 2:

Input: chargeTimes = [11,12,19], runningCosts = [10,8,7], budget = 19

Choose any two distinct indices i and j and simultaneously update the values of nums[i] to (nums[i] AND nums[j]) and nums[j] to (nums[i] OR nums[j]). Here, OR denotes the bitwise OR operation, and AND denotes the bitwise AND operation.

You have to choose k elements from the final array and calculate the sum of their squares.
Return the maximum sum of squares you can achieve.
Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,6,5,8], k = 2
Output: 261
Explanation: We can do the following operations on the array:
- Choose i = 0 and j = 3, then change nums[0] to (2 AND 8) = 0 and nums[3] to (2 OR 8) = 10. The resulting array is nums = [0,6,5,10].
- Choose i = 2 and j = 3, then change nums[2] to (5 AND 10) = 0 and nums[3] to (5 OR 10) = 15. The resulting array is nums = [0,6,0,15].
We can choose the elements 15 and 6 from the final array. The sum of squares is 152 + 62 = 261.
It can be shown that this is the maximum value we can get.

put-marbles-in-bags,"You have k bags. You are given a 0-indexed integer array weights where weights[i] is the weight of the ith marble. You are also given the integer k.
Divide the marbles into the k bags according to the following rules:

No bag is empty.
If the ith marble and jth marble are in a bag, then all marbles with an index between the ith and jth indices should also be in that same bag.
If a bag consists of all the marbles with an index from i to j inclusively, then the cost of the bag is weights[i] + weights[j].

The score after distributing the marbles is the sum of the costs of all the k bags.
Return the difference between the maximum and minimum scores among marble distributions.
??
Example 1:

Input: weights = [1,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: 
The distribution [1],[3,5,1] results in the minimal score of (1+1) + (3+1) = 6. 
The distribution [1,3],[5,1], results in the maximal score of (1+3) + (5+1) = 10. 
Thus, we return their difference 10 - 6 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: weights = [1, 3], k = 2
Output: 0
Explanation: The only distribution possible is [1],[3]. 
Since both the maximal and minimal score are the same, we return 0.

earliest-second-to-mark-indices-i,"You are given two 1-indexed integer arrays, nums and, changeIndices, having lengths n and m, respectively.
Initially, all indices in nums are unmarked. Your task is to mark all indices in nums.
In each second, s, in order from 1 to m (inclusive), you can perform one of the following operations:

Choose an index i in the range [1, n] and decrement nums[i] by 1.
If nums[changeIndices[s]] is equal to 0, mark the index changeIndices[s].
Do nothing.

Return an integer denoting the earliest second in the range [1, m] when all indices in nums can be marked by choosing operations optimally, or -1 if it is impossible.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,2,0], changeIndices = [2,2,2,2,3,2,2,1]
Output: 8
Explanation: In this example, we have 8 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [1,2,0].
Second 2: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,2,0].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,1,0].
Second 4: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [0,0,0].
Second 5: Mark the index changeIndices[5], which is marking index 3, since nums[3] is equal to 0.
Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 7: Do nothing.
Second 8: Mark the index changeIndices[8], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 8th second.
Hence, the answer is 8.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3], changeIndices = [1,1,1,2,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: In this example, we have 7 seconds. The following operations can be performed to mark all indices:
Second 1: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,2].
Second 2: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,1].
Second 3: Choose index 2 and decrement nums[2] by one. nums becomes [1,0].
Second 4: Mark the index changeIndices[4], which is marking index 2, since nums[2] is equal to 0.
Second 5: Choose index 1 and decrement nums[1] by one. nums becomes [0,0].
Second 6: Mark the index changeIndices[6], which is marking index 1, since nums[1] is equal to 0.
Now all indices have been marked.
It can be shown that it is not possible to mark all indices earlier than the 6th second.
Hence, the answer is 6.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [0,1], changeIndices = [2,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: In this example, it is impossible to mark all indices because index 1 isn't in changeIndices.
Hence, the answer is -1.

We used 2 operations so return 2. It can be proven that 2 is the maximum number of operations needed.
Note that in the second operation we cannot delete ""abc"" again because the next occurrence of ""abc"" does not happen in the next 3 letters.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""aaabaab""
Output: 4
Explanation:
- Delete the first letter (""a"") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = ""aabaab"".
- Delete the first 3 letters (""aab"") since the next 3 letters are equal. Now, s = ""aab"".
- Delete the first letter (""a"") since the next letter is equal. Now, s = ""ab"".

minimum-difference-in-sums-after-removal-of-elements,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of 3 * n elements.
You are allowed to remove any subsequence of elements of size exactly n from nums. The remaining 2 * n elements will be divided into two equal parts:

The first n elements belonging to the first part and their sum is sumfirst.
The next n elements belonging to the second part and their sum is sumsecond.

The difference in sums of the two parts is denoted as sumfirst - sumsecond.

For example, if sumfirst = 3 and sumsecond = 2, their difference is 1.
Similarly, if sumfirst = 2 and sumsecond = 3, their difference is -1.

Return the minimum difference possible between the sums of the two parts after the removal of n elements.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: Here, nums has 3 elements, so n = 1. 
Thus we have to remove 1 element from nums and divide the array into two equal parts.
- If we remove nums[0] = 3, the array will be [1,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 1 - 2 = -1.
- If we remove nums[1] = 1, the array will be [3,2]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 2 = 1.
- If we remove nums[2] = 2, the array will be [3,1]. The difference in sums of the two parts will be 3 - 1 = 2.
The minimum difference between sums of the two parts is min(-1,1,2) = -1. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [7,9,5,8,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: Here n = 2. So we must remove 2 elements and divide the remaining array into two parts containing two elements each.
If we remove nums[2] = 5 and nums[3] = 8, the resultant array will be [7,9,1,3]. The difference in sums will be (7+9) - (1+3) = 12.
To obtain the minimum difference, we should remove nums[1] = 9 and nums[4] = 1. The resultant array becomes [7,5,8,3]. The difference in sums of the two parts is (7+5) - (8+3) = 1.
It can be shown that it is not possible to obtain a difference smaller than 1.

split-array-into-maximum-number-of-subarrays,"You are given an array nums consisting of non-negative integers.
We define the score of subarray nums[l..r] such that l <= r as nums[l] AND nums[l + 1] AND ... AND nums[r] where AND is the bitwise AND operation.
Consider splitting the array into one or more subarrays such that the following conditions are satisfied:

Each element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray.
The sum of scores of the subarrays is the minimum possible.

Return the maximum number of subarrays in a split that satisfies the conditions above.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,2,0,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: We can split the array into the following subarrays:
- [1,0]. The score of this subarray is 1 AND 0 = 0.
- [2,0]. The score of this subarray is 2 AND 0 = 0.
- [1,2]. The score of this subarray is 1 AND 2 = 0.
The sum of scores is 0 + 0 + 0 = 0, which is the minimum possible score that we can obtain.
It can be shown that we cannot split the array into more than 3 subarrays with a total score of 0. So we return 3.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,7,1,3]
Output: 1
Explanation: We can split the array into one subarray: [5,7,1,3] with a score of 1, which is the minimum possible score that we can obtain.
It can be shown that we cannot split the array into more than 1 subarray with a total score of 1. So we return 1.

count-operations-to-obtain-zero,"You are given two non-negative integers num1 and num2.
In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.

For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. However, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.

Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.
??
Example 1:

Input: num1 = 2, num2 = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 2, num2 = 3. Since num1 < num2, we subtract num1 from num2 and get num1 = 2, num2 = 3 - 2 = 1.
- Operation 2: num1 = 2, num2 = 1. Since num1 > num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
- Operation 3: num1 = 1, num2 = 1. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 1. Since num1 == 0, we do not need to perform any further operations.
So the total number of operations required is 3.

Example 2:

Input: num1 = 10, num2 = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Operation 1: num1 = 10, num2 = 10. Since num1 == num2, we subtract num2 from num1 and get num1 = 10 - 10 = 0.
Now num1 = 0 and num2 = 10. Since num1 == 0, we are done.

The number of cells in the set has to be greater than 1 and all cells must be fertile.
The apex of a pyramid is the topmost cell of the pyramid. The height of a pyramid is the number of rows it covers. Let (r, c) be the apex of the pyramid, and its height be h. Then, the plot comprises of cells (i, j) where r <= i <= r + h - 1 and c - (i - r) <= j <= c + (i - r).

- Number 3 is in row 0, and number 2 is in row 2, so 3 is above 2 in the matrix.

- Number 3 is in column 0, and number 2 is in column 1, so 3 is left of 2 in the matrix.

The length of a jump is the absolute difference between the position of the stone the frog is currently on and the position of the stone to which the frog jumps.

Choose index i = 4 and increase nums[4] by 1 -> [2,4,0,0,3].

number-of-beautiful-integers-in-the-range,"You are given positive integers low, high, and k.
A number is beautiful if it meets both of the following conditions:

The count of even digits in the number is equal to the count of odd digits.
The number is divisible by k.

Return the number of beautiful integers in the range [low, high].
??
Example 1:

Input: low = 10, high = 20, k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 beautiful integers in the given range: [12,18]. 
- 12 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
- 18 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
Additionally we can see that:
- 16 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 3.
- 15 is not beautiful because it does not contain equal counts even and odd digits.
It can be shown that there are only 2 beautiful integers in the given range.

Example 2:

Input: low = 1, high = 10, k = 1
Output: 1
Explanation: There is 1 beautiful integer in the given range: [10].

count-of-interesting-subarrays,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums, an integer modulo, and an integer k.
Your task is to find the count of subarrays that are interesting.
A subarray nums[l..r] is interesting if the following condition holds:

Let cnt be the number of indices i in the range [l, r] such that nums[i] % modulo == k. Then, cnt % modulo == k.

Return an integer denoting the count of interesting subarrays. 
Note: A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,4], modulo = 2, k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example the interesting subarrays are: 
The subarray nums[0..0] which is [3]. 
- There is only one index, i = 0, in the range [0, 0] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 1 and cnt % modulo == k.  
The subarray nums[0..1] which is [3,2].
- There is only one index, i = 0, in the range [0, 1] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k.  
- Hence, cnt = 1 and cnt % modulo == k.
The subarray nums[0..2] which is [3,2,4].

It can be shown that there are no other interesting subarrays. So, the answer is 3.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,1,9,6], modulo = 3, k = 0
Output: 2
Explanation: In this example the interesting subarrays are: 
The subarray nums[0..3] which is [3,1,9,6]. 
- There are three indices, i = 0, 2, 3, in the range [0, 3] that satisfy nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 3 and cnt % modulo == k. 
The subarray nums[1..1] which is [1]. 
- There is no index, i, in the range [1, 1] that satisfies nums[i] % modulo == k. 
- Hence, cnt = 0 and cnt % modulo == k.

stone-game-iii,"Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array stoneValue.
Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the first remaining stones in the row.
The score of each player is the sum of the values of the stones taken. The score of each player is 0 initially.
The objective of the game is to end with the highest score, and the winner is the player with the highest score and there could be a tie. The game continues until all the stones have been taken.
Assume Alice and Bob play optimally.
Return ""Alice"" if Alice will win, ""Bob"" if Bob will win, or ""Tie"" if they will end the game with the same score.
??
Example 1:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,7]
Output: ""Bob""
Explanation: Alice will always lose. Her best move will be to take three piles and the score become 6. Now the score of Bob is 7 and Bob wins.

Example 2:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,-9]
Output: ""Alice""
Explanation: Alice must choose all the three piles at the first move to win and leave Bob with negative score.
If Alice chooses one pile her score will be 1 and the next move Bob's score becomes 5. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and lose.
If Alice chooses two piles her score will be 3 and the next move Bob's score becomes 3. In the next move, Alice will take the pile with value = -9 and also lose.
Remember that both play optimally so here Alice will choose the scenario that makes her win.

Example 3:

Input: stoneValue = [1,2,3,6]

Given an array of strings arr, and an integer k, return the kth distinct string present in arr. If there are fewer than k distinct strings, return an empty string """".
Note that the strings are considered in the order in which they appear in the array.
??
Example 1:

Input: arr = [""d"",""b"",""c"",""b"",""c"",""a""], k = 2
Output: ""a""
Explanation:
The only distinct strings in arr are ""d"" and ""a"".
""d"" appears 1st, so it is the 1st distinct string.
""a"" appears 2nd, so it is the 2nd distinct string.
Since k == 2, ""a"" is returned. 

Example 2:

Input: arr = [""aaa"",""aa"",""a""], k = 1
Output: ""aaa""
Explanation:
All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1st string ""aaa"" is returned.

Example 3:

Input: arr = [""a"",""b"",""a""], k = 3
Output: """"
Explanation:
The only distinct string is ""b"". Since there are fewer than 3 distinct strings, we return an empty string """".

sort-matrix-by-diagonals,"You are given an n x n square matrix of integers grid. Return the matrix such that:

The diagonals in the bottom-left triangle (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in non-increasing order.

??
Example 1:

Input: grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]
Explanation:

The diagonals with a black arrow (bottom-left triangle) should be sorted in non-increasing order:

[1, 8, 6] becomes [8, 6, 1].
[9, 5] and [4] remain unchanged.

The diagonals with a blue arrow (top-right triangle) should be sorted in non-decreasing order:

[7, 2] becomes [2, 7].
[3] remains unchanged.


Example 2:

Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,2]]

Explanation:

The diagonals with a black arrow must be non-increasing, so [0, 2] is changed to [2, 0]. The other diagonals are already in the correct order.

There are n different types of metals available, and you have access to k machines that can be used to create alloys. Each machine requires a specific amount of each metal type to create an alloy.
For the ith machine to create an alloy, it needs composition[i][j] units of metal of type j. Initially, you have stock[i] units of metal type i, and purchasing one unit of metal type i costs cost[i] coins.
Given integers n, k, budget, a 1-indexed 2D array composition, and 1-indexed arrays stock and cost, your goal is to maximize the number of alloys the company can create while staying within the budget of budget coins.

Explanation: It is optimal to use the 1st machine to create alloys.
To create 2 alloys we need to buy the:
- 2 units of metal of the 1st type.
- 2 units of metal of the 2nd type.

- 5 units of metal of the 2nd type.
- 0 units of metal of the 3rd type.
In total, we need 5 * 1 + 5 * 2 + 0 * 3 = 15 coins, which is smaller than or equal to budget = 15.

robot-collisions,"There are n 1-indexed robots, each having a position on a line, health, and movement direction.
You are given 0-indexed integer arrays positions, healths, and a string directions (directions[i] is either 'L' for left or 'R' for right). All integers in positions are unique.
All robots start moving on the line simultaneously at the same speed in their given directions. If two robots ever share the same position while moving, they will collide.
If two robots collide, the robot with lower health is removed from the line, and the health of the other robot decreases by one. The surviving robot continues in the same direction it was going. If both robots have the same health, they are both removed from the line.
Your task is to determine the health of the robots that survive the collisions, in the same order that the robots were given, i.e. final health of robot 1 (if survived), final health of robot 2 (if survived), and so on. If there are no survivors, return an empty array.
Return an array containing the health of the remaining robots (in the order they were given in the input), after no further collisions can occur.

Explanation: No collision occurs in this example, since all robots are moving in the same direction. So, the health of the robots in order from the first robot is returned, [2, 17, 9, 15, 10].

Example 2:


Input: positions = [3,5,2,6], healths = [10,10,15,12], directions = ""RLRL""
Output: [14]
Explanation: There are 2 collisions in this example. Firstly, robot 1 and robot 2 will collide, and since both have the same health, they will be removed from the line. Next, robot 3 and robot 4 will collide and since robot 4's health is smaller, it gets removed, and robot 3's health becomes 15 - 1 = 14. Only robot 3 remains, so we return [14].

Example 3:


Input: positions = [1,2,5,6], healths = [10,10,11,11], directions = ""RLRL""
Output: []
Explanation: Robot 1 and robot 2 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. Robot 3 and 4 will collide and since both have the same health, they are both removed. So, we return an empty array, [].

You are also given an integer array queries of size m. For the ith query, you want to make all of the elements of nums equal to queries[i]. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

Increase or decrease an element of the array by 1.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to queries[i].
Note that after each query the array is reset to its original state.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,6,8], queries = [1,5]
Output: [14,10]
Explanation: For the first query we can do the following operations:
- Decrease nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [1,1,6,8].
- Decrease nums[2] 5 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,8].
- Decrease nums[3] 7 times, so that nums = [1,1,1,1].
So the total number of operations for the first query is 2 + 5 + 7 = 14.
For the second query we can do the following operations:
- Increase nums[0] 2 times, so that nums = [5,1,6,8].
- Increase nums[1] 4 times, so that nums = [5,5,6,8].
- Decrease nums[2] 1 time, so that nums = [5,5,5,8].
- Decrease nums[3] 3 times, so that nums = [5,5,5,5].
So the total number of operations for the second query is 2 + 4 + 1 + 3 = 10.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,9,6,3], queries = [10]

Example 1:

Input: nums = [4,6,1,2], k = 2

- Choose index 1, replace it with 4 (from range [4,8]), nums = [4,4,1,2].
- Choose index 3, replace it with 4 (from range [0,4]), nums = [4,4,1,4].

Swap the positions of two elements nums[i] and nums[j] if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1 where gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) is the greatest common divisor of nums[i] and nums[j].

Return true if it is possible to sort nums in non-decreasing order using the above swap method, or false otherwise.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [7,21,3]
Output: true
Explanation: We can sort [7,21,3] by performing the following operations:
- Swap 7 and 21 because gcd(7,21) = 7. nums = [21,7,3]
- Swap 21 and 3 because gcd(21,3) = 3. nums = [3,7,21]

Example 2:

Input: nums = [5,2,6,2]

Explanation: It is impossible to sort the array because 5 cannot be swapped with any other element.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [10,5,9,3,15]

Return the maximum area of a square field that can be formed by removing some fences (possibly none) or -1 if it is impossible to make a square field.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Note: The field is surrounded by two horizontal fences from the coordinates (1, 1) to (1, n) and (m, 1) to (m, n) and two vertical fences from the coordinates (1, 1) to (m, 1) and (1, n) to (m, n). These fences cannot be removed.

smallest-subarrays-with-maximum-bitwise-or,"You are given a 0-indexed array nums of length n, consisting of non-negative integers. For each index i from 0 to n - 1, you must determine the size of the minimum sized non-empty subarray of nums starting at i (inclusive) that has the maximum possible bitwise OR.

In other words, let Bij be the bitwise OR of the subarray nums[i...j]. You need to find the smallest subarray starting at i, such that bitwise OR of this subarray is equal to max(Bik) where i <= k <= n - 1.

The bitwise OR of an array is the bitwise OR of all the numbers in it.
Return an integer array answer of size n where answer[i] is the length of the minimum sized subarray starting at i with maximum bitwise OR.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,0,2,1,3]
Output: [3,3,2,2,1]
Explanation:
The maximum possible bitwise OR starting at any index is 3. 
- Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields it is [1,0,2].
- Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [0,2,1].
- Starting at index 2, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [2,1].
- Starting at index 3, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [1,3].
- Starting at index 4, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is [3].
Therefore, we return [3,3,2,2,1]. 

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2]
Output: [2,1]
Explanation:
Starting at index 0, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is of length 2.
Starting at index 1, the shortest subarray that yields the maximum bitwise OR is of length 1.
Therefore, we return [2,1].

- Swap values at indices 1 and 2, incurring cost = 1 + 2 = 3. Now, nums1 = [4,3,2,1,5].

Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [2,2,2,1,3], nums2 = [1,2,2,3,3]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
One of the ways we can perform the operations is:
- Swap values at indices 2 and 3, incurring cost = 2 + 3 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,2,1,2,3].
- Swap values at indices 1 and 4, incurring cost = 1 + 4 = 5. Now, nums1 = [2,3,1,2,2].
The total cost needed here is 10, which is the minimum possible.

Example 3:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2], nums2 = [1,2,2]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
It can be shown that it is not possible to satisfy the given conditions irrespective of the number of operations we perform.
Hence, we return -1.

naming-a-company,"You are given an array of strings ideas that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. The process of naming a company is as follows:

Choose 2 distinct names from ideas, call them ideaA and ideaB.
Swap the first letters of ideaA and ideaB with each other.
If both of the new names are not found in the original ideas, then the name ideaA ideaB (the concatenation of ideaA and ideaB, separated by a space) is a valid company name.
Otherwise, it is not a valid name.

Return the number of distinct valid names for the company.
??
Example 1:

Input: ideas = [""coffee"",""donuts"",""time"",""toffee""]
Output: 6
Explanation: The following selections are valid:
- (""coffee"", ""donuts""): The company name created is ""doffee conuts"".
- (""donuts"", ""coffee""): The company name created is ""conuts doffee"".
- (""donuts"", ""time""): The company name created is ""tonuts dime"".
- (""donuts"", ""toffee""): The company name created is ""tonuts doffee"".
- (""time"", ""donuts""): The company name created is ""dime tonuts"".
- (""toffee"", ""donuts""): The company name created is ""doffee tonuts"".
Therefore, there are a total of 6 distinct company names.

The following are some examples of invalid selections:
- (""coffee"", ""time""): The name ""toffee"" formed after swapping already exists in the original array.
- (""time"", ""toffee""): Both names are still the same after swapping and exist in the original array.
- (""coffee"", ""toffee""): Both names formed after swapping already exist in the original array.

sum-of-digit-differences-of-all-pairs,"You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers where all integers have the same number of digits.
The digit difference between two integers is the count of different digits that are in the same position in the two integers.
Return the sum of the digit differences between all pairs of integers in nums.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [13,23,12]
Output: 4
Explanation:
We have the following:
- The digit difference between 13 and 23 is 1.
- The digit difference between 13 and 12 is 1.
- The digit difference between 23 and 12 is 2.
So the total sum of digit differences between all pairs of integers is 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,10,10,10]

Explanation:
All the integers in the array are the same. So the total sum of digit differences between all pairs of integers will be 0.

cherry-pickup-ii,"You are given a rows x cols matrix grid representing a field of cherries where grid[i][j] represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the (i, j) cell.
You have two robots that can collect cherries for you:

Robot #1 is located at the top-left corner (0, 0), and
Robot #2 is located at the top-right corner (0, cols - 1).

Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:

Example 1:

Input: str1 = ""abc"", str2 = ""ad""

Explanation: Select index 2 in str1.
Increment str1[2] to become 'd'.

Example 2:

Input: str1 = ""zc"", str2 = ""ad""

Explanation: Select indices 0 and 1 in str1.

apply-operations-to-maximize-score,"You are given an array nums of n positive integers and an integer k.
Initially, you start with a score of 1. You have to maximize your score by applying the following operation at most k times:

Choose any non-empty subarray nums[l, ..., r] that you haven't chosen previously.
Choose an element x of nums[l, ..., r] with the highest prime score. If multiple such elements exist, choose the one with the smallest index.
Multiply your score by x.

Here, nums[l, ..., r] denotes the subarray of nums starting at index l and ending at the index r, both ends being inclusive.
The prime score of an integer x is equal to the number of distinct prime factors of x. For example, the prime score of 300 is 3 since 300 = 2 * 2 * 3 * 5 * 5.
Return the maximum possible score after applying at most k operations.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2
Output: 81
Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [19,12,14,6,10,18], k = 3
Output: 4788
Explanation: To get a score of 4788, we can apply the following operations: 
- Choose subarray nums[0, ..., 0]. nums[0] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[0]. The score becomes 1 * 19 = 19.
- Choose subarray nums[5, ..., 5]. nums[5] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[5]. The score becomes 19 * 18 = 342.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 2, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multipy the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 342 * 14 = 4788.
It can be proven that 4788 is the highest score one can obtain.

For example, trimmed([3,1,2,4,3,4]) = [3,4,3,4].

The importance value of a subarray is k + trimmed(subarray).length.

For example, if a subarray is [1,2,3,3,3,4,4], then trimmed([1,2,3,3,3,4,4]) = [3,3,3,4,4].The importance value of this subarray will be k + 5.

A partition of a string s is called good if:

Each digit of s is part of exactly one substring.
The value of each substring is less than or equal to k.

Return the minimum number of substrings in a good partition of s. If no good partition of s exists, return -1.
Note that:

The value of a string is its result when interpreted as an integer. For example, the value of ""123"" is 123 and the value of ""1"" is 1.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

Explanation: We can partition the string into substrings ""16"", ""54"", ""6"", and ""2"". Each substring has a value less than or equal to k = 60.
It can be shown that we cannot partition the string into less than 4 substrings.

A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the graph's edges that connects all vertices without cycles??and with the minimum possible total edge weight.
Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph's minimum spanning tree (MST). An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a??critical edge. On??the other hand, a pseudo-critical edge is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.
Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

Input: n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]
Output: [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]
Explanation: The figure above describes the graph.
The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.
The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

Example 2:


Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]
Output: [[],[0,1,2,3]]
Explanation: We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

You are also given two 0-indexed character arrays original and changed, and an integer array cost, where cost[i] represents the cost of changing the character original[i] to the character changed[i].
You start with the string source. In one operation, you can pick a character x from the string and change it to the character y at a cost of z if there exists any index j such that cost[j] == z, original[j] == x, and changed[j] == y.
Return the minimum cost to convert the string source to the string target using any number of operations. If it is impossible to convert source to target, return -1.
Note that there may exist indices i, j such that original[j] == original[i] and changed[j] == changed[i].

Example 1:

Input: source = ""abcd"", target = ""acbe"", original = [""a"",""b"",""c"",""c"",""e"",""d""], changed = [""b"",""c"",""b"",""e"",""b"",""e""], cost = [2,5,5,1,2,20]
Output: 28
Explanation: To convert the string ""abcd"" to string ""acbe"":
- Change value at index 1 from 'b' to 'c' at a cost of 5.
- Change value at index 2 from 'c' to 'e' at a cost of 1.
- Change value at index 2 from 'e' to 'b' at a cost of 2.
- Change value at index 3 from 'd' to 'e' at a cost of 20.
The total cost incurred is 5 + 1 + 2 + 20 = 28.
It can be shown that this is the minimum possible cost.

Example 2:

Input: source = ""aaaa"", target = ""bbbb"", original = [""a"",""c""], changed = [""c"",""b""], cost = [1,2]
Output: 12
Explanation: To change the character 'a' to 'b' change the character 'a' to 'c' at a cost of 1, followed by changing the character 'c' to 'b' at a cost of 2, for a total cost of 1 + 2 = 3. To change all occurrences of 'a' to 'b', a total cost of 3 * 4 = 12 is incurred.

Example 3:

Input: source = ""abcd"", target = ""abce"", original = [""a""], changed = [""e""], cost = [10000]
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to convert source to target because the value at index 3 cannot be changed from 'd' to 'e'.

minimum-cost-to-change-the-final-value-of-expression,"You are given a valid boolean expression as a string expression consisting of the characters '1','0','&' (bitwise AND operator),'|' (bitwise OR operator),'(', and ')'.

For example, ""()1|1"" and ""(1)&()"" are not valid while ""1"", ""(((1))|(0))"", and ""1|(0&(1))"" are valid expressions.

Return the minimum cost to change the final value of the expression.

For example, if expression = ""1|1|(0&0)&1"", its value is 1|1|(0&0)&1 = 1|1|0&1 = 1|0&1 = 1&1 = 1. We want to apply operations so that the new expression evaluates to 0.

The cost of changing the final value of an expression is the number of operations performed on the expression. The types of operations are described as follows:

Turn a '1' into a '0'.
Turn a '0' into a '1'.
Turn a '&' into a '|'.
Turn a '|' into a '&'.

Note: '&' does not take precedence over '|' in the order of calculation. Evaluate parentheses first, then in left-to-right order.
??
Example 1:

Input: expression = ""1&(0|1)""
Output: 1
Explanation: We can turn ""1&(0|1)"" into ""1&(0&1)"" by changing the '|' to a '&' using 1 operation.
The new expression evaluates to 0. 

Example 2:

Input: expression = ""(0&0)&(0&0&0)""
Output: 3
Explanation: We can turn ""(0&0)&(0&0&0)"" into ""(0|1)|(0&0&0)"" using 3 operations.
The new expression evaluates to 1.

Example 3:

Input: expression = ""(0|(1|0&1))""

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,5,6,8,5], k = 4

The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to 1.
There is at least a gap of 2 rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the ith roll is equal to the value of the jth roll, then abs(i - j) > 2.

Return the total number of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Some invalid sequences are (1, 2, 1, 3), (1, 2, 3, 6).
(1, 2, 1, 3) is invalid since the first and third roll have an equal value and abs(1 - 3) = 2 (i and j are 1-indexed).

Given an integer array cuts where cuts[i] denotes a position you should perform a cut at.
You should perform the cuts in order, you can change the order of the cuts as you wish.
The cost of one cut is the length of the stick to be cut, the total cost is the sum of costs of all cuts. When you cut a stick, it will be split into two smaller sticks (i.e. the sum of their lengths is the length of the stick before the cut). Please refer to the first example for a better explanation.
Return the minimum total cost of the cuts.
??
Example 1:


Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order = [1, 3, 4, 5] as in the input leads to the following scenario:

The first cut is done to a rod of length 7 so the cost is 7. The second cut is done to a rod of length 6 (i.e. the second part of the first cut), the third is done to a rod of length 4 and the last cut is to a rod of length 3. The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
Rearranging the cuts to be [3, 5, 1, 4] for example will lead to a scenario with total cost = 16 (as shown in the example photo 7 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 16).

get-the-maximum-score,"You are given two sorted arrays of distinct integers nums1 and nums2.
A valid path is defined as follows:

Choose array nums1 or nums2 to traverse (from index-0).
Traverse the current array from left to right.
If you are reading any value that is present in nums1 and nums2 you are allowed to change your path to the other array. (Only one repeated value is considered in the valid path).

The score is defined as the sum of unique values in a valid path.
Return the maximum score you can obtain of all possible valid paths. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

You are allowed to perform a series of operations (possibly none).
In an operation, you select an index i in the range [0, n - 1] and swap the values of nums1[i] and nums2[i].
Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to satisfy the following conditions:

nums1[n - 1] is equal to the maximum value among all elements of nums1, i.e., nums1[n - 1] = max(nums1[0], nums1[1], ..., nums1[n - 1]).

For example, [""one"", ""two"", ""three""] represents the path ""/one/two/three"".

Two folders (not necessarily on the same level) are identical if they contain the same non-empty set of identical subfolders and underlying subfolder structure. The folders do not need to be at the root level to be identical. If two or more folders are identical, then mark the folders as well as all their subfolders.

For example, folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" in the file structure below are identical. They (as well as their subfolders) should all be marked:

	
/a
/a/x
/a/x/y
/a/z
/b
/b/x
/b/x/y
/b/z


However, if the file structure also included the path ""/b/w"", then the folders ""/a"" and ""/b"" would not be identical. Note that ""/a/x"" and ""/b/x"" would still be considered identical even with the added folder.

Remove two distinct edges of the tree to form three connected components. For a pair of removed edges, the following steps are defined:

Get the XOR of all the values of the nodes for each of the three components respectively.
The difference between the largest XOR value and the smallest XOR value is the score of the pair.


For example, say the three components have the node values: [4,5,7], [1,9], and [3,3,3]. The three XOR values are 4 ^ 5 ^ 7 = 6, 1 ^ 9 = 8, and 3 ^ 3 ^ 3 = 3. The largest XOR value is 8 and the smallest XOR value is 3. The score is then 8 - 3 = 5.

- The 2nd component has node [0] with value [1]. Its XOR value is 1 = 1.
- The 3rd component has node [2] with value [5]. Its XOR value is 5 = 5.
The score is the difference between the largest and smallest XOR value which is 10 - 1 = 9.
It can be shown that no other pair of removals will obtain a smaller score than 9.

count-visited-nodes-in-a-directed-graph,"There is a directed graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n directed edges.
You are given a 0-indexed array edges where edges[i] indicates that there is an edge from node i to node edges[i].
Consider the following process on the graph:

You start from a node x and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this same process.

Return an array answer where answer[i] is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node i.
??
Example 1:


Input: edges = [1,2,0,0]
Output: [3,3,3,4]
Explanation: We perform the process starting from each node in the following way:
- Starting from node 0, we visit the nodes 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 1, we visit the nodes 1 -> 2 -> 0 -> 1. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 2, we visit the nodes 2 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2. The number of different nodes we visit is 3.
- Starting from node 3, we visit the nodes 3 -> 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0. The number of different nodes we visit is 4.

ant-on-the-boundary,"An ant is on a boundary. It sometimes goes left and sometimes right.
You are given an array of non-zero integers nums. The ant starts reading nums from the first element of it to its end. At each step, it moves according to the value of the current element:

If nums[i] < 0, it moves left by -nums[i] units.
If nums[i] > 0, it moves right by nums[i] units.

Return the number of times the ant returns to the boundary.
Notes:

There is an infinite space on both sides of the boundary.
We check whether the ant is on the boundary only after it has moved |nums[i]| units. In other words, if the ant crosses the boundary during its movement, it does not count.

??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,-5]
Output: 1
Explanation: After the first step, the ant is 2 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the third step, the ant is on the boundary.
So the answer is 1.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,2,-3,-4]
Output: 0
Explanation: After the first step, the ant is 3 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the second step, the ant is 5 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the third step, the ant is 2 steps to the right of the boundary.
After the fourth step, the ant is 2 steps to the left of the boundary.
The ant never returned to the boundary, so the answer is 0.

earliest-possible-day-of-full-bloom,"You have n flower seeds. Every seed must be planted first before it can begin to grow, then bloom. Planting a seed takes time and so does the growth of a seed. You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays plantTime and growTime, of length n each:

plantTime[i] is the number of full days it takes you to plant the ith seed. Every day, you can work on planting exactly one seed. You do not have to work on planting the same seed on consecutive days, but the planting of a seed is not complete until you have worked plantTime[i] days on planting it in total.
growTime[i] is the number of full days it takes the ith seed to grow after being completely planted. After the last day of its growth, the flower blooms and stays bloomed forever.

From the beginning of day 0, you can plant the seeds in any order.
Return the earliest possible day where all seeds are blooming.

Example 1:


Input: plantTime = [1,4,3], growTime = [2,3,1]

Explanation: The grayed out pots represent planting days, colored pots represent growing days, and the flower represents the day it blooms.
One optimal way is:
On day 0, plant the 0th seed. The seed grows for 2 full days and blooms on day 3.

Furthermore, you are given a 0-indexed integer array time where time[i] denotes how many months it takes to complete the (i+1)th course.
You must find the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses following these rules:

You may start taking a course at any time if the prerequisites are met.
Any number of courses can be taken at the same time.

Return the minimum number of months needed to complete all the courses.
Note: The test cases are generated such that it is possible to complete every course (i.e., the graph is a directed acyclic graph).

Example 1:


Input: n = 3, relations = [[1,3],[2,3]], time = [3,2,5]
Output: 8
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course. 
We start course 1 and course 2 simultaneously at month 0.
Course 1 takes 3 months and course 2 takes 2 months to complete respectively.
Thus, the earliest time we can start course 3 is at month 3, and the total time required is 3 + 5 = 8 months.

Example 2:


Input: n = 5, relations = [[1,5],[2,5],[3,5],[3,4],[4,5]], time = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 12
Explanation: The figure above represents the given graph and the time required to complete each course.
You can start courses 1, 2, and 3 at month 0.
You can complete them after 1, 2, and 3 months respectively.
Course 4 can be taken only after course 3 is completed, i.e., after 3 months. It is completed after 3 + 4 = 7 months.
Course 5 can be taken only after courses 1, 2, 3, and 4 have been completed, i.e., after max(1,2,3,7) = 7 months.
Thus, the minimum time needed to complete all the courses is 7 + 5 = 12 months.

Return the minimum number of increments you need to make the cost of paths from the root to each leaf node equal.
Note:

A perfect binary tree is a tree where each node, except the leaf nodes, has exactly 2 children.
The cost of a path is the sum of costs of nodes in the path.

Example 1:


Input: n = 7, cost = [1,5,2,2,3,3,1]

Explanation: We can do the following increments:
- Increase the cost of node 4 one time.
- Increase the cost of node 3 three times.
- Increase the cost of node 7 two times.
Each path from the root to a leaf will have a total cost of 9.

closest-equal-element-queries,"You are given a circular array nums and an array queries.
For each query i, you have to find the following:

The minimum distance between the element at index queries[i] and any other index j in the circular array, where nums[j] == nums[queries[i]]. If no such index exists, the answer for that query should be -1.

Return an array answer of the same size as queries, where answer[i] represents the result for query i.
??
Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,1,4,1,3,2], queries = [0,3,5]
Output: [2,-1,3]
Explanation:

Query 0: The element at queries[0] = 0 is nums[0] = 1. The nearest index with the same value is 2, and the distance between them is 2.
Query 1: The element at queries[1] = 3 is nums[3] = 4. No other index contains 4, so the result is -1.
Query 2: The element at queries[2] = 5 is nums[5] = 3. The nearest index with the same value is 1, and the distance between them is 3 (following the circular path: 5 -> 6 -> 0 -> 1).


Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [0,1,2,3]
Output: [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Explanation:
Each value in nums is unique, so no index shares the same value as the queried element. This results in -1 for all queries.

Each events[i] can be either of the following two types:

Message Event: [""MESSAGE"", ""timestampi"", ""mentions_stringi""]

This event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at timestampi.
The mentions_stringi string can contain one of the following tokens:
		
id<number>: where <number> is an integer in range [0,numberOfUsers - 1]. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.
ALL: mentions all users.
HERE: mentions all online users.




Offline Event: [""OFFLINE"", ""timestampi"", ""idi""]

This event indicates that the user idi had become offline at timestampi for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time timestampi + 60.



Return an array mentions where mentions[i] represents the number of mentions the user with id i has across all MESSAGE events.

Explanation:

Split arr into two contiguous subarrays: [-7] and [9, 5] and rearrange them as [9, 5, -7], with a cost of 2.
Subtract 2 from element arr[0]. The array becomes [7, 5, -7]. The cost of this operation is 2.
Subtract 7 from element arr[1]. The array becomes [7, -2, -7]. The cost of this operation is 7.
Add 2 to element arr[2]. The array becomes [7, -2, -5]. The cost of this operation is 2.

Choose any digit from n that is not 0 and decrease it by 1.

The integer n must not be a prime number at any point, including its original value and after each operation.
The cost of a transformation is the sum of all values that n takes throughout the operations performed.
Return the minimum cost to transform n into m. If it is impossible, return -1.
??
Example 1:

Input: n = 10, m = 12
Output: 85
Explanation:
We perform the following operations:

Increase the first digit, now n = 20.
Increase the second digit, now n = 21.
Increase the second digit, now n = 22.
Decrease the first digit, now n = 12.


Example 2:

Input: n = 4, m = 8
Output: -1
Explanation:
It is impossible to make n equal to m.

Example 3:

Input: n = 6, m = 2
Output: -1
Explanation:??
Since 2 is already a prime, we can't make n equal to m.

??
Constraints:

1 <= n, m < 104
n and m consist of the same number of digits.

minimum-time-to-break-locks-i,"Bob is stuck in a dungeon and must break n locks, each requiring some amount of energy to break. The required energy for each lock is stored in an array called strength where strength[i] indicates the energy needed to break the ith lock.
To break a lock, Bob uses a sword with the following characteristics:

The initial energy of the sword is 0.
The initial factor x by which the energy of the sword increases is 1.
Every minute, the energy of the sword increases by the current factor x.
To break the ith lock, the energy of the sword must reach at least strength[i].
After breaking a lock, the energy of the sword resets to 0, and the factor x increases by a given value k.

Your task is to determine the minimum time in minutes required for Bob to break all n locks and escape the dungeon.

maximize-total-cost-of-alternating-subarrays,"You are given an integer array nums with length n.
The cost of a subarray nums[l..r], where 0 <= l <= r < n, is defined as:
cost(l, r) = nums[l] - nums[l + 1] + ... + nums[r] * (???????1)r ??????? l
Your task is to split nums into subarrays such that the total cost of the subarrays is maximized, ensuring each element belongs to exactly one subarray.
Formally, if nums is split into k subarrays, where k > 1, at indices i1, i2, ..., ik ??????? 1, where 0 <= i1 < i2 < ... < ik - 1 < n - 1, then the total cost will be:

Example 1:

Explanation:
One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -2, 3, 4] into subarrays [1, -2, 3] and [4]. The total cost will be (1 + 2 + 3) + 4 = 10.

One way to maximize the total cost is by splitting [1, -1, 1, -1] into subarrays [1, -1] and [1, -1]. The total cost will be (1 + 1) + (1 + 1) = 4.

Explanation:
We cannot split the array further, so the answer is 0.

replace-question-marks-in-string-to-minimize-its-value,"You are given a string s. s[i] is either a lowercase English letter or '?'.
For a string t having length m containing only lowercase English letters, we define the function cost(i) for an index i??as the number of characters equal to t[i]??that appeared before it, i.e. in the range [0, i - 1].
The value of t is the sum of cost(i) for all indices i.
For example, for the string t = ""aab"":

cost(0) = 0
cost(1) = 1
cost(2) = 0
Hence, the value of ""aab"" is 0 + 1 + 0 = 1.

Your task is to replace all occurrences of '?' in s with any lowercase English letter so that the value of s is minimized.
Return a string denoting the modified string with replaced occurrences of '?'. If there are multiple strings resulting in the minimum value, return the lexicographically smallest one.
??
Example 1:

Input:   s = ""???"" 
Output:   ""abc"" 
Explanation:  In this example, we can replace the occurrences of '?' to make s equal to ""abc"".
For ""abc"", cost(0) = 0, cost(1) = 0, and cost(2) = 0.
The value of ""abc"" is 0.
Some other modifications of s that have a value of 0 are ""cba"", ""abz"", and, ""hey"".
Among all of them, we choose the lexicographically smallest.

Example 2:

Input:  s = ""a?a?""
Output:  ""abac""
Explanation:  In this example, the occurrences of '?' can be replaced to make s equal to ""abac"".
For ""abac"", cost(0) = 0, cost(1) = 0, cost(2) = 1, and cost(3) = 0.
The value of ""abac"" is??1.

In one operation, you can swap any two adjacent elements if they have the same number of set bits. You are allowed to do this operation any number of times (including zero).
Return true if you can sort the array in ascending order, else return false.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [8,4,2,30,15]
Output: true
Explanation: Let's look at the binary representation of every element. The numbers 2, 4, and 8 have one set bit each with binary representation ""10"", ""100"", and ""1000"" respectively. The numbers 15 and 30 have four set bits each with binary representation ""1111"" and ""11110"".
We can sort the array using 4 operations:
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 8 and 4 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,8,2,30,15].
- Swap nums[1] with nums[2]. This operation is valid because 8 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [4,2,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[0] with nums[1]. This operation is valid because 4 and 2 have one set bit each. The array becomes [2,4,8,30,15].
- Swap nums[3] with nums[4]. This operation is valid because 30 and 15 have four set bits each. The array becomes [2,4,8,15,30].
The array has become sorted, hence we return true.
Note that there may be other sequences of operations which also sort the array.

Explanation: The array is already sorted, hence we return true.

(c, d) denotes the position of the white bishop.
(e, f) denotes the position of the black queen.

Given that you can only move the white pieces, return the minimum number of moves required to capture the black queen.
Note that:

Rooks can move any number of squares either vertically or horizontally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
Bishops can move any number of squares diagonally, but cannot jump over other pieces.
A rook or a bishop can capture the queen if it is located in a square that they can move to.

Explanation: We can capture the black queen in two moves by moving the white rook to (1, 3) then to (2, 3).
It is impossible to capture the black queen in less than two moves since it is not being attacked by any of the pieces at the beginning.

First operation on enemy 1: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 1, and currentEnergy = 0.
Second operation on enemy 0: currentEnergy increases by 3, and enemy 0 is marked. So, points = 1, currentEnergy = 3, and marked enemies = [0].
First operation on enemy 2: points increases by 1, and currentEnergy decreases by 2. So, points = 2, currentEnergy = 1, and marked enemies = [0].

Choose an index i in the range [0, n - 1], and a positive integer x.
Add |nums[i] - x| to the total cost.
Change the value of nums[i] to x.

A palindromic number is a positive integer that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, 121, 2552 and 65756 are palindromic numbers whereas 24, 46, 235 are not palindromic numbers.

maximum-score-after-applying-operations-on-a-tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and rooted at node 0. You are given??a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
You are also given a 0-indexed integer array values of length n, where values[i] is the value associated with the ith node.
You start with a score of 0. In one operation, you can:

Pick any node i.
Add values[i] to your score.
Set values[i] to 0.

A tree is healthy if the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf node is different than zero.
Return the maximum score you can obtain after performing these operations on the tree any number of times so that it remains healthy.
??
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3],[2,4],[4,5]], values = [5,2,5,2,1,1]
Output: 11
Explanation: We can choose nodes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. The value of the root is non-zero. Hence, the sum of values on the path from the root to any leaf is different than zero. Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[1] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] + values[5] = 11.
It can be shown that 11 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[2,6]], values = [20,10,9,7,4,3,5]
Output: 40
Explanation: We can choose nodes 0, 2, 3, and 4.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 4 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 3 is equal to 10.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 5 is equal to 3.
- The sum of values on the path from 0 to 6 is equal to 5.
Therefore, the tree is healthy and the score is values[0] + values[2] + values[3] + values[4] = 40.
It can be shown that 40 is the maximum score obtainable after any number of operations on the tree.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [5,1,4,1], indexDifference = 2, valueDifference = 4
Output: [0,3]
Explanation: In this example, i = 0 and j = 3 can be selected.
abs(0 - 3) >= 2 and abs(nums[0] - nums[3]) >= 4.
Hence, a valid answer is [0,3].
[3,0] is also a valid answer.

Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,1], indexDifference = 0, valueDifference = 0

minimum-cost-of-a-path-with-special-roads,"You are given an array start where start = [startX, startY] represents your initial position (startX, startY) in a 2D space. You are also given the array target where target = [targetX, targetY] represents your target position (targetX, targetY).
The cost of going from a position (x1, y1) to any other position in the space (x2, y2) is |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|.
There are also some special roads. You are given a 2D array specialRoads where specialRoads[i] = [x1i, y1i, x2i, y2i, costi] indicates that the ith special road goes in one direction from (x1i, y1i) to (x2i, y2i) with a cost equal to costi. You can use each special road any number of times.
Return the minimum cost required to go from (startX, startY) to (targetX, targetY).
??
Example 1:

Input: start = [1,1], target = [4,5], specialRoads = [[1,2,3,3,2],[3,4,4,5,1]]
Output: 5
Explanation:

(1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.
(1,2) to (3,3). Use specialRoads[0] with the cost 2.
(3,3) to (3,4) with a cost of |3 - 3| + |4 - 3| = 1.
(3,4) to (4,5). Use specialRoads[1] with the cost 1.

So the total cost is 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5.

Output: 7
Explanation:
It is optimal not to use any special edges and go directly from the starting to the ending position with a cost |5 - 3| + |7 - 2| = 7.
Note that the specialRoads[0] is directed from (5,7) to (3,2).

Explanation:

(1,1) to (1,2) with a cost of |1 - 1| + |2 - 1| = 1.
(1,2) to (7,4). Use specialRoads[1] with the cost 4.

most-profitable-path-in-a-tree,"There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, rooted at node 0. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1 where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
At every node i, there is a gate. You are also given an array of even integers amount, where amount[i] represents:

the price needed to open the gate at node i, if amount[i] is negative, or,
the cash reward obtained on opening the gate at node i, otherwise.

The game goes on as follows:

Initially, Alice is at node 0 and Bob is at node bob.
At every second, Alice and Bob each move to an adjacent node. Alice moves towards some leaf node, while Bob moves towards node 0.
For every node along their path, Alice and Bob either spend money to open the gate at that node, or accept the reward. Note that:
	
If the gate is already open, no price will be required, nor will there be any cash reward.
If Alice and Bob reach the node simultaneously, they share the price/reward for opening the gate there. In other words, if the price to open the gate is c, then both Alice and Bob pay??c / 2 each. Similarly, if the reward at the gate is c, both of them receive c / 2 each.


If Alice reaches a leaf node, she stops moving. Similarly, if Bob reaches node 0, he stops moving. Note that these events are independent of each other.

Return the maximum net income Alice can have if she travels towards the optimal leaf node.
??
Example 1:


Input: edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3],[3,4]], bob = 3, amount = [-2,4,2,-4,6]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The above diagram represents the given tree. The game goes as follows:
- Alice is initially on node 0, Bob on node 3. They open the gates of their respective nodes.
  Alice's net income is now -2.
- Both Alice and Bob move to node 1. 
?? Since they reach here simultaneously, they open the gate together and share the reward.
?? Alice's net income becomes -2 + (4 / 2) = 0.
- Alice moves on to node 3. Since Bob already opened its gate, Alice's income remains unchanged.
?? Bob moves on to node 0, and stops moving.
- Alice moves on to node 4 and opens the gate there. Her net income becomes 0 + 6 = 6.
Now, neither Alice nor Bob can make any further moves, and the game ends.
It is not possible for Alice to get a higher net income.

Example 2:


Input: edges = [[0,1]], bob = 1, amount = [-7280,2350]
Output: -7280
Explanation: 
Alice follows the path 0->1 whereas Bob follows the path 1->0.
Thus, Alice opens the gate at node 0 only. Hence, her net income is -7280.

smallest-substring-with-identical-characters-ii,"You are given a binary string s of length n and an integer numOps.
You are allowed to perform the following operation on s at most numOps times:

Select any index i (where 0 <= i < n) and flip s[i]. If s[i] == '1', change s[i] to '0' and vice versa.

You need to minimize the length of the longest substring of s such that all the characters in the substring are identical.
Return the minimum length after the operations.

minimum-cost-good-caption,"You are given a string caption of length n. A good caption is a string where every character appears in groups of at least 3 consecutive occurrences.
For example:

""aaabbb"" and ""aaaaccc"" are good captions.
""aabbb"" and ""ccccd"" are not good captions.

Choose an index i (where 0 <= i < n) and change the character at that index to either:

The character immediately before it in the alphabet (if caption[i] != 'a').
The character immediately after it in the alphabet (if caption[i] != 'z').

Your task is to convert the given caption into a good caption using the minimum number of operations, and return it. If there are multiple possible good captions, return the lexicographically smallest one among them. If it is impossible to create a good caption, return an empty string """".
??
Example 1:

Input: caption = ""cdcd""
Output: ""cccc""
Explanation:
It can be shown that the given caption cannot be transformed into a good caption with fewer than 2 operations. The possible good captions that can be created using exactly 2 operations are:

""dddd"": Change caption[0] and caption[2] to their next character 'd'.
""cccc"": Change caption[1] and caption[3] to their previous character 'c'.

Since ""cccc"" is lexicographically smaller than ""dddd"", return ""cccc"".

Example 2:

Input: caption = ""aca""
Output: ""aaa""
Explanation:
It can be proven that the given caption requires at least 2 operations to be transformed into a good caption. The only good caption that can be obtained with exactly 2 operations is as follows:

Operation 1: Change caption[1] to 'b'. caption = ""aba"".
Operation 2: Change caption[1] to 'a'. caption = ""aaa"".

check-if-dfs-strings-are-palindromes,"You are given a tree rooted at node 0, consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The tree is represented by an array parent of size n, where parent[i] is the parent of node i. Since node 0 is the root, parent[0] == -1.
You are also given a string s of length n, where s[i] is the character assigned to node i.
Consider an empty string dfsStr, and define a recursive function dfs(int x) that takes a node x as a parameter and performs the following steps in order:

Iterate over each child y of x in increasing order of their numbers, and call dfs(y).
Add the character s[x] to the end of the string dfsStr.

Note that dfsStr is shared across all recursive calls of dfs.
You need to find a boolean array answer of size n, where for each index i from 0 to n - 1, you do the following:

Empty the string dfsStr and call dfs(i).
If the resulting string dfsStr is a palindrome, then set answer[i] to true. Otherwise, set answer[i] to false.

Return the array answer.
??
Example 1:


Input: parent = [-1,0,0,1,1,2], s = ""aababa""
Output: [true,true,false,true,true,true]
Explanation:

Calling dfs(0) results in the string dfsStr = ""abaaba"", which is a palindrome.
Calling dfs(1) results in the string dfsStr = ""aba"", which is a palindrome.
Calling dfs(2) results in the string dfsStr = ""ab"", which is not a palindrome.
Calling dfs(3) results in the string dfsStr = ""a"", which is a palindrome.
Calling dfs(4) results in the string dfsStr = ""b"", which is a palindrome.
Calling dfs(5) results in the string dfsStr = ""a"", which is a palindrome.


Example 2:


Input: parent = [-1,0,0,0,0], s = ""aabcb""
Output: [true,true,true,true,true]
Explanation:
Every call on dfs(x) results in a palindrome string.

count-the-number-of-winning-sequences,"Alice and Bob are playing a fantasy battle game consisting of n rounds where they summon one of three magical creatures each round: a Fire Dragon, a Water Serpent, or an Earth Golem. In each round, players simultaneously summon their creature and are awarded points as follows:

If one player summons a Fire Dragon and the other summons an Earth Golem, the player who summoned the Fire Dragon is awarded a point.
If one player summons a Water Serpent and the other summons a Fire Dragon, the player who summoned the Water Serpent is awarded a point.
If one player summons an Earth Golem and the other summons a Water Serpent, the player who summoned the Earth Golem is awarded a point.
If both players summon the same creature, no player is awarded a point.

You are given a string s consisting of n characters 'F', 'W', and 'E', representing the sequence of creatures Alice will summon in each round:

If s[i] == 'F', Alice summons a Fire Dragon.
If s[i] == 'W', Alice summons a Water Serpent.

You are given two integers kx and ky where (kx, ky) denotes the position of the knight, and a 2D array positions where positions[i] = [xi, yi] denotes the position of the pawns on the chessboard.
Alice and Bob play a turn-based game, where Alice goes first. In each player's turn:

The player selects a pawn that still exists on the board and captures it with the knight in the fewest possible moves. Note that the player can select any pawn, it might not be one that can be captured in the least number of moves.
In the process of capturing the selected pawn, the knight may pass other pawns without capturing them. Only the selected pawn can be captured in this turn.

Alice is trying to maximize the sum of the number of moves made by both players until there are no more pawns on the board, whereas Bob tries to minimize them.
Return the maximum total number of moves made during the game that Alice can achieve, assuming both players play optimally.
Note that in one move, a chess knight has eight possible positions it can move to, as illustrated below. Each move is two cells in a cardinal direction, then one cell in an orthogonal direction.

The almost equal pairs of elements are:

1 and 10. By swapping the digits 1 and 0 in 10, you get 01 which is 1.
1 and 100. By swapping the second 0 with the digit 1 in 100, you get 001, which is 1.
10 and 100. By swapping the first 0 with the digit 1 in 100, you get 010, which is 10.

Second 2: Set nums[changeIndices[2]] to 0. nums becomes [0,2,0].
Second 3: Set nums[changeIndices[3]] to 0. nums becomes [0,0,0].

1. Replace nums[0] and nums[1] with (nums[0] & nums[1]) so that nums becomes equal to [3,15,14,2,8]. 
2. Replace nums[0] and nums[1] with (nums[0] & nums[1]) so that nums becomes equal to [3,14,2,8].
3. Replace nums[0] and nums[1] with (nums[0] & nums[1]) so that nums becomes equal to [2,2,8].
4. Replace nums[1] and nums[2] with (nums[1] & nums[2]) so that nums becomes equal to [2,0].
The bitwise-or of the final array is 2.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of the remaining elements of nums after applying at most k operations.

Example 3:

Input: nums = [10,7,10,3,9,14,9,4], k = 1
Output: 15
Explanation: Without applying any operations, the bitwise-or of nums is 15.
It can be shown that 15 is the minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of the remaining elements of nums after applying at most k operations.

count-the-number-of-powerful-integers,"You are given three integers start, finish, and limit. You are also given a 0-indexed string s representing a positive integer.
A positive integer x is called powerful if it ends with s (in other words, s is a suffix of x) and each digit in x is at most limit.
Return the total number of powerful integers in the range [start..finish].
A string x is a suffix of a string y if and only if x is a substring of y that starts from some index (including 0) in y and extends to the index y.length - 1. For example, 25 is a suffix of 5125 whereas 512 is not.
??
Example 1:

Input: start = 1, finish = 6000, limit = 4, s = ""124""
Output: 5
Explanation: The powerful integers in the range [1..6000] are 124, 1124, 2124, 3124, and, 4124. All these integers have each digit <= 4, and ""124"" as a suffix. Note that 5124 is not a powerful integer because the first digit is 5 which is greater than 4.
It can be shown that there are only 5 powerful integers in this range.

Example 2:

Output: 2
Explanation: The powerful integers in the range [15..215] are 110 and 210. All these integers have each digit <= 6, and ""10"" as a suffix.
It can be shown that there are only 2 powerful integers in this range.

Example 3:

maximize-the-number-of-partitions-after-operations,"You are given a string s and an integer k.
First, you are allowed to change at most one index in s to another lowercase English letter.
After that, do the following partitioning operation until s is empty:

Choose the longest prefix of s containing at most k distinct characters.
Delete the prefix from s and increase the number of partitions by one. The remaining characters (if any) in s maintain their initial order.

Return an integer denoting the maximum number of resulting partitions after the operations by optimally choosing at most one index to change.
??
Example 1:

Input: s = ""accca"", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
The optimal way is to change s[2] to something other than a and c, for example, b. then it becomes ""acbca"".
Then we perform the operations:

The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is ""ac"", we remove it and s becomes ""bca"".
Now The longest prefix containing at most 2 distinct characters is ""bc"", so we remove it and s becomes ""a"".
Finally, we remove ""a"" and s becomes empty, so the procedure ends.

Doing the operations, the string is divided into 3 partitions, so the answer is 3.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""aabaab"", k = 3
Output: 1
Explanation:
Initially??s??contains 2 distinct characters, so whichever character we change, it will contain at most 3 distinct characters, so the longest prefix with at most 3 distinct characters would always be all of it, therefore the answer is 1.

Example 3:

Input: s = ""xxyz"", k = 1
Output: 4
Explanation:
The optimal way is to change??s[0]??or??s[1]??to something other than characters in??s, for example, to change??s[0]??to??w.
Then??s??becomes ""wxyz"", which consists of 4 distinct characters, so as k is 1, it will divide into 4 partitions.

Each query is answered independently of the others.
Return a 0-indexed array answer, where answer[i] == true if it is possible to make s a palindrome by performing operations specified by the ith query, and false otherwise.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
s[x:y] represents the substring consisting of characters from the index x to index y in s, both inclusive.

??
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abcabc"", queries = [[1,1,3,5],[0,2,5,5]]
Output: [true,true]
Explanation: In this example, there are two queries:
In the first query:
- a0 = 1, b0 = 1, c0 = 3, d0 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:1] => abcabc and s[3:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[3:5] can be rearranged to become => abccba.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.
In the second query:
- a1 = 0, b1 = 2, c1 = 5, d1 = 5.
- So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abcabc and s[5:5] => abcabc.
- To make s a palindrome, s[0:2] can be rearranged to become => cbaabc.
- Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[1] = true.

Example 2:

Input: s = ""abbcdecbba"", queries = [[0,2,7,9]]
Output: [false]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 0, b0 = 2, c0 = 7, d0 = 9.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[0:2] => abbcdecbba and s[7:9] => abbcdecbba.
It is not possible to make s a palindrome by rearranging these substrings because s[3:6] is not a palindrome.
So, answer[0] = false.
Example 3:

Input: s = ""acbcab"", queries = [[1,2,4,5]]
Output: [true]
Explanation: In this example, there is only one query.
a0 = 1, b0 = 2, c0 = 4, d0 = 5.
So, you are allowed to rearrange s[1:2] => acbcab and s[4:5] => acbcab.
To make s a palindrome s[1:2] can be rearranged to become abccab.
Then, s[4:5] can be rearranged to become abccba.
Now, s is a palindrome. So, answer[0] = true.

Return the maximum score you can achieve.
The frequency of an element is the number of occurences of that element in the array.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,6,4], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: We can do the following operations on the array:
- Choose i = 0, and increase the value of nums[0] by 1. The resulting array is [2,2,6,4].
- Choose i = 3, and decrease the value of nums[3] by 1. The resulting array is [2,2,6,3].
- Choose i = 3, and decrease the value of nums[3] by 1. The resulting array is [2,2,6,2].
The element 2 is the most frequent in the final array so our score is 3.

maximum-points-after-collecting-coins-from-all-nodes,"There exists an undirected tree rooted at node 0 with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree. You are also given a 0-indexed array coins of size n where coins[i] indicates the number of coins in the vertex i, and an integer k.
Starting from the root, you have to collect all the coins such that the coins at a node can only be collected if the coins of its ancestors have been already collected.
Coins at nodei can be collected in one of the following ways:

Collect all the coins, but you will get coins[i] - k points. If coins[i] - k is negative then you will lose abs(coins[i] - k) points.
Collect all the coins, but you will get floor(coins[i] / 2) points. If this way is used, then for all the nodej present in the subtree of nodei, coins[j] will get reduced to floor(coins[j] / 2).

Return the maximum points you can get after collecting the coins from all the tree nodes.

Collect all the coins from node 0 using the first way. Total points = 10 - 5 = 5.
Collect all the coins from node 1 using the first way. Total points = 5 + (10 - 5) = 10.
Collect all the coins from node 2 using the second way so coins left at node 3 will be floor(3 / 2) = 1. Total points = 10 + floor(3 / 2) = 11.
Collect all the coins from node 3 using the second way. Total points = 11 + floor(1 / 2) = 11.
It can be shown that the maximum points we can get after collecting coins from all the nodes is 11.

Input: edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], coins = [8,4,4], k = 0

On the second day, we buy product 4 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][4] * 2 = 4.
On the third day, we buy product 3 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][3] * 3 = 9.
On the fourth day, we buy product 3 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][3] * 4 = 16.
On the fifth day, we buy product 2 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][2] * 5 = 25.
On the sixth day, we buy product 2 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][2] * 6 = 36.
On the seventh day, we buy product 1 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][1] * 7 = 49.
On the eighth day, we buy product 1 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][1] * 8 = 64
On the ninth day, we buy product 0 from shop 1 for a price of values[1][0] * 9 = 81.
On the tenth day, we buy product 0 from shop 0 for a price of values[0][0] * 10 = 100.
Hence, our total spending is equal to 386.
It can be shown that 386 is the maximum amount of money that can be spent buying all m * n products.

minimum-changes-to-make-k-semi-palindromes,"Given a string s and an integer k, partition s into k substrings such that the letter changes needed to make each substring a semi-palindrome??are minimized.
Return the minimum number of letter changes required.
A semi-palindrome is a special type of string that can be divided into palindromes based on a repeating pattern. To check if a string is a semi-palindrome:???????

Choose a positive divisor d of the string's length. d can range from 1 up to, but not including, the string's length. For a string of length 1, it does not have a valid divisor as per this definition, since the only divisor is its length, which is not allowed.
For a given divisor d, divide the string into groups where each group contains characters from the string that follow a repeating pattern of length d. Specifically, the first group consists of characters at positions 1, 1 + d, 1 + 2d, and so on; the second group includes characters at positions 2, 2 + d, 2 + 2d, etc.
The string is considered a semi-palindrome if each of these groups forms a palindrome.

Consider the string ""abcabc"":

The length of ""abcabc"" is 6. Valid divisors are 1, 2, and 3.
For d = 1: The entire string ""abcabc"" forms one group. Not a palindrome.
For d = 2:
	
Group 1 (positions 1, 3, 5): ""acb""
Group 2 (positions 2, 4, 6): ""bac""
Neither group forms a palindrome.


For d = 3:
	
Group 1 (positions 1, 4): ""aa""
Group 2 (positions 2, 5): ""bb""
Group 3 (positions 3, 6): ""cc""
All groups form palindromes. Therefore, ""abcabc"" is a semi-palindrome.



??
Example 1: 

Input:   s = ""abcac"", k = 2 
Output:   1 
Explanation:  Divide s into ""ab"" and ""cac"". ""cac"" is already semi-palindrome. Change ""ab"" to ""aa"", it becomes semi-palindrome with d = 1.

Example 2: 

Input:   s = ""abcdef"", k = 2 
Output:   2 
Explanation:  Divide s into substrings ""abc"" and ""def"". Each??needs one change to become semi-palindrome.

Example 3: 

Input:   s = ""aabbaa"", k = 3 
Output:   0 
Explanation:  Divide s into substrings ""aa"", ""bb"" and ""aa"".??All are already semi-palindromes.

find-the-string-with-lcp,"We define the lcp matrix of any 0-indexed string word of n lowercase English letters as an n x n grid such that:

lcp[i][j] is equal to the length of the longest common prefix between the substrings word[i,n-1] and word[j,n-1].

Given an??n x n matrix lcp, return the alphabetically smallest string word that corresponds to lcp. If there is no such string, return an empty string.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b. For example, ""aabd"" is lexicographically smaller than ""aaca"" because the first position they differ is at the third letter, and 'b' comes before 'c'.
??
Example 1:

Input: lcp = [[4,0,2,0],[0,3,0,1],[2,0,2,0],[0,1,0,1]]

You are allowed to remove any number of characters from the string t.
The score of the string is 0 if no characters are removed from the string t, otherwise:

Let left be the minimum index among all removed characters.
Let right be the maximum index among all removed characters.

Then the score of the string is right - left + 1.
Return the minimum possible score to make t??a subsequence of s.
A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., ""ace"" is a subsequence of ""abcde"" while ""aec"" is not).
??
Example 1:

Input: s = ""abacaba"", t = ""bzaa""
Output: 1
Explanation: In this example, we remove the character ""z"" at index 1 (0-indexed).
The string t becomes ""baa"" which is a subsequence of the string ""abacaba"" and the score is 1 - 1 + 1 = 1.
It can be proven that 1 is the minimum score that we can achieve.

maximize-the-minimum-powered-city,"You are given a 0-indexed integer array stations of length n, where stations[i] represents the number of power stations in the ith city.
Each power station can provide power to every city in a fixed range. In other words, if the range is denoted by r, then a power station at city i can provide power to all cities j such that |i - j| <= r and 0 <= i, j <= n - 1.

Note that |x| denotes absolute value. For example, |7 - 5| = 2 and |3 - 10| = 7.

The power of a city is the total number of power stations it is being provided power from.
The government has sanctioned building k more power stations, each of which can be built in any city, and have the same range as the pre-existing ones.
Given the two integers r and k, return the maximum possible minimum power of a city, if the additional power stations are built optimally.
Note that you can build the k power stations in multiple cities.
??
Example 1:

Input: stations = [1,2,4,5,0], r = 1, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
One of the optimal ways is to install both the power stations at city 1. 
So stations will become [1,4,4,5,0].
- City 0 is provided by 1 + 4 = 5 power stations.
- City 1 is provided by 1 + 4 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 2 is provided by 4 + 4 + 5 = 13 power stations.
- City 3 is provided by 5 + 4 = 9 power stations.
- City 4 is provided by 5 + 0 = 5 power stations.
So the minimum power of a city is 5.
Since it is not possible to obtain a larger power, we return 5.

Input: stations = [4,4,4,4], r = 0, k = 3

Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.
Note:

The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.

The minimum number of flowers in any of the incomplete gardens multiplied by partial. If there are no incomplete gardens, then this value will be 0.

Output: 30
Explanation: Alice can plant
- 3 flowers in the 0th garden
- 0 flowers in the 1st garden
- 0 flowers in the 2nd garden
- 2 flowers in the 3rd garden
The gardens will then be [5,4,5,5]. She planted a total of 3 + 0 + 0 + 2 = 5 flowers.
There are 3 gardens that are complete.
The minimum number of flowers in the incomplete gardens is 4.
Thus, the total beauty is 3 * 2 + 4 * 6 = 6 + 24 = 30.

maximum-fruits-harvested-after-at-most-k-steps,"Fruits are available at some positions on an infinite x-axis. You are given a 2D integer array fruits where fruits[i] = [positioni, amounti] depicts amounti fruits at the position positioni. fruits is already sorted by positioni in ascending order, and each positioni is unique.
You are also given an integer startPos and an integer k. Initially, you are at the position startPos. From any position, you can either walk to the left or right. It takes one step to move one unit on the x-axis, and you can walk at most k steps in total. For every position you reach, you harvest all the fruits at that position, and the fruits will disappear from that position.
Return the maximum total number of fruits you can harvest.
??
Example 1:


Input: fruits = [[2,8],[6,3],[8,6]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 9
Explanation: 
The optimal way is to:
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 3 fruits
- Move right to position 8 and harvest 6 fruits
You moved 3 steps and harvested 3 + 6 = 9 fruits in total.

Example 2:


Input: fruits = [[0,9],[4,1],[5,7],[6,2],[7,4],[10,9]], startPos = 5, k = 4
Output: 14
Explanation: 
You can move at most k = 4 steps, so you cannot reach position 0 nor 10.
The optimal way is to:
- Harvest the 7 fruits at the starting position 5
- Move left to position 4 and harvest 1 fruit
- Move right to position 6 and harvest 2 fruits
- Move right to position 7 and harvest 4 fruits
You moved 1 + 3 = 4 steps and harvested 7 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 14 fruits in total.

Example 3:


Input: fruits = [[0,3],[6,4],[8,5]], startPos = 3, k = 2
Output: 0

You can move at most k = 2 steps and cannot reach any position with fruits.

Each task has a strength requirement stored in a 0-indexed integer array tasks, with the ith task requiring tasks[i] strength to complete. The strength of each worker is stored in a 0-indexed integer array workers, with the jth worker having workers[j] strength. Each worker can only be assigned to a single task and must have a strength greater than or equal to the task's strength requirement (i.e., workers[j] >= tasks[i]).
Additionally, you have pills magical pills that will increase a worker's strength by strength. You can decide which workers receive the magical pills, however, you may only give each worker at most one magical pill.
Given the 0-indexed integer arrays tasks and workers and the integers pills and strength, return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed.

Example 1:

Input: tasks = [3,2,1], workers = [0,3,3], pills = 1, strength = 1

number-of-valid-move-combinations-on-chessboard,"There is an 8 x 8 chessboard containing n pieces (rooks, queens, or bishops). You are given a string array pieces of length n, where pieces[i] describes the type (rook, queen, or bishop) of the ith piece. In addition, you are given a 2D integer array positions also of length n, where positions[i] = [ri, ci] indicates that the ith piece is currently at the 1-based coordinate (ri, ci) on the chessboard.
When making a move for a piece, you choose a destination square that the piece will travel toward and stop on.

A rook can only travel horizontally or vertically from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), or (r, c-1).
A queen can only travel horizontally, vertically, or diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c), (r-1, c), (r, c+1), (r, c-1), (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).
A bishop can only travel diagonally from (r, c) to the direction of (r+1, c+1), (r+1, c-1), (r-1, c+1), (r-1, c-1).

You must make a move for every piece on the board simultaneously. A move combination consists of all the moves performed on all the given pieces. Every second, each piece will instantaneously travel one square towards their destination if they are not already at it. All pieces start traveling at the 0th second. A move combination is invalid if, at a given time, two or more pieces occupy the same square.

The tournament consists of multiple rounds (starting from round number 1). In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round. When the number of players is odd for the current round, the player in the middle automatically advances to the next round.

For example, if the row consists of players 1, 2, 4, 6, 7

Player 1 competes against player 7.
Player 2 competes against player 6.
Player 4 automatically advances to the next round.



After each round is over, the winners are lined back up in the row based on the original ordering assigned to them initially (ascending order).
The players numbered firstPlayer and secondPlayer are the best in the tournament. They can win against any other player before they compete against each other. If any two other players compete against each other, either of them might win, and thus you may choose the outcome of this round.

To arrive at your meeting, you have to travel through n roads. The road lengths are given as an integer array dist of length n, where dist[i] describes the length of the ith road in kilometers. In addition, you are given an integer speed, which is the speed (in km/h) you will travel at.
After you travel road i, you must rest and wait for the next integer hour before you can begin traveling on the next road. Note that you do not have to rest after traveling the last road because you are already at the meeting.

For example, if traveling a road takes 1.4 hours, you must wait until the 2 hour mark before traveling the next road. If traveling a road takes exactly??2??hours, you do not need to wait.

However, you are allowed to skip some rests to be able to arrive on time, meaning you do not need to wait for the next integer hour. Note that this means you may finish traveling future roads at different hour marks.

For example, suppose traveling the first road takes 1.4 hours and traveling the second road takes 0.6 hours. Skipping the rest after the first road will mean you finish traveling the second road right at the 2 hour mark, letting you start traveling the third road immediately.

Return the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time, or -1 if it is impossible.

You can skip the first rest to arrive in ((1/4 + 0) + (3/4 + 0)) + (2/4) = 1.5 hours.
Note that the second rest is shortened because you finish traveling the second road at an integer hour due to skipping the first rest.

Example 2:

Input: dist = [7,3,5,5], speed = 2, hoursBefore = 10
Output: 2
Explanation:
Without skipping any rests, you will arrive in (7/2 + 1/2) + (3/2 + 1/2) + (5/2 + 1/2) + (5/2) = 11.5 hours.
You can skip the first and third rest to arrive in ((7/2 + 0) + (3/2 + 0)) + ((5/2 + 0) + (5/2)) = 10 hours.

tree-of-coprimes,"There is a tree (i.e.,??a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. Each node has a value associated with it, and the root of the tree is node 0.
To represent this tree, you are given an integer array nums and a 2D array edges. Each nums[i] represents the ith node's value, and each edges[j] = [uj, vj] represents an edge between nodes uj and vj in the tree.
Two values x and y are coprime if gcd(x, y) == 1 where gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.
An ancestor of a node i is any other node on the shortest path from node i to the root. A node is not considered an ancestor of itself.
Return an array ans of size n, where ans[i] is the closest ancestor to node i such that nums[i] and nums[ans[i]] are coprime, or -1 if there is no such ancestor.

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,3,3,2], edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[1,3]]
Output: [-1,0,0,1]
Explanation: In the above figure, each node's value is in parentheses.
- Node 0 has no coprime ancestors.
- Node 1 has only one ancestor, node 0. Their values are coprime (gcd(2,3) == 1).
- Node 2 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. Node 1's value is not coprime (gcd(3,3) == 3), but node 0's
  value is (gcd(2,3) == 1), so node 0 is the closest valid ancestor.
- Node 3 has two ancestors, nodes 1 and 0. It is coprime with node 1 (gcd(3,2) == 1), so node 1 is its
  closest valid ancestor.

maximize-grid-happiness,"You are given four integers, m, n, introvertsCount, and extrovertsCount. You have an m x n grid, and there are two types of people: introverts and extroverts. There are introvertsCount introverts and extrovertsCount extroverts.
You should decide how many people you want to live in the grid and assign each of them one grid cell. Note that you do not have to have all the people living in the grid.
The happiness of each person is calculated as follows:

Introverts start with 120 happiness and lose 30 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).
Extroverts start with 40 happiness and gain 20 happiness for each neighbor (introvert or extrovert).

Neighbors live in the directly adjacent cells north, east, south, and west of a person's cell.
The grid happiness is the sum of each person's happiness. Return the maximum possible grid happiness.
??
Example 1:


Input: m = 2, n = 3, introvertsCount = 1, extrovertsCount = 2
Output: 240
Explanation: Assume the grid is 1-indexed with coordinates (row, column).
We can put the introvert in cell (1,1) and put the extroverts in cells (1,3) and (2,3).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (0 * 30) (0 neighbors) = 120
- Extrovert at (1,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
- Extrovert at (2,3) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (1 * 20) (1 neighbor) = 60
The grid happiness is 120 + 60 + 60 = 240.
The above figure shows the grid in this example with each person's happiness. The introvert stays in the light green cell while the extroverts live on the light purple cells.

Example 2:

Input: m = 3, n = 1, introvertsCount = 2, extrovertsCount = 1
Output: 260
Explanation: Place the two introverts in (1,1) and (3,1) and the extrovert at (2,1).
- Introvert at (1,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
- Extrovert at (2,1) happiness: 40 (starting happiness) + (2 * 20) (2 neighbors) = 80
- Introvert at (3,1) happiness: 120 (starting happiness) - (1 * 30) (1 neighbor) = 90
The grid happiness is 90 + 80 + 90 = 260.

paint-house-iii,"There is a row of m houses in a small city, each house must be painted with one of the n colors (labeled from 1 to n), some houses that have been painted last summer should not be painted again.
A neighborhood is a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

For example: houses = [1,2,2,3,3,2,1,1] contains 5 neighborhoods [{1}, {2,2}, {3,3}, {2}, {1,1}].

Given an array houses, an m x n matrix cost and an integer target where:

houses[i]: is the color of the house i, and 0 if the house is not painted yet.
cost[i][j]: is the cost of paint the house i with the color j + 1.

Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses in such a way that there are exactly target neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return -1.
??
Example 1:

Input: houses = [0,0,0,0,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: Paint houses of this way [1,2,2,1,1]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{1}, {2,2}, {1,1}].
Cost of paint all houses (1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 5) = 9.

Example 2:

Input: houses = [0,2,1,2,0], cost = [[1,10],[10,1],[10,1],[1,10],[5,1]], m = 5, n = 2, target = 3
Output: 11
Explanation: Some houses are already painted, Paint the houses of this way [2,2,1,2,2]
This array contains target = 3 neighborhoods, [{2,2}, {1}, {2,2}]. 
Cost of paint the first and last house (10 + 1) = 11.

Example 3:

Input: houses = [3,1,2,3], cost = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], m = 4, n = 3, target = 3
Output: -1
Explanation: Houses are already painted with a total of 4 neighborhoods [{3},{1},{2},{3}] different of target = 3.

probability-of-a-two-boxes-having-the-same-number-of-distinct-balls,"Given 2n balls of k distinct colors. You will be given an integer array balls of size k where balls[i] is the number of balls of color i.
All the balls will be shuffled uniformly at random, then we will distribute the first n balls to the first box and the remaining n balls to the other box (Please read the explanation of the second example carefully).
Please note that the two boxes are considered different. For example, if we have two balls of colors a and b, and two boxes [] and (), then the distribution [a] (b) is considered different than the distribution [b] (a) (Please read the explanation of the first example carefully).
Return the probability that the two boxes have the same number of distinct balls. Answers within 10-5 of the actual value will be accepted as correct.
??
Example 1:

Input: balls = [1,1]
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Only 2 ways to divide the balls equally:
- A ball of color 1 to box 1 and a ball of color 2 to box 2
- A ball of color 2 to box 1 and a ball of color 1 to box 2
In both ways, the number of distinct colors in each box is equal. The probability is 2/2 = 1

Example 2:

Input: balls = [2,1,1]
Output: 0.66667
Explanation: We have the set of balls [1, 1, 2, 3]
This set of balls will be shuffled randomly and we may have one of the 12 distinct shuffles with equal probability (i.e. 1/12):
[1,1 / 2,3], [1,1 / 3,2], [1,2 / 1,3], [1,2 / 3,1], [1,3 / 1,2], [1,3 / 2,1], [2,1 / 1,3], [2,1 / 3,1], [2,3 / 1,1], [3,1 / 1,2], [3,1 / 2,1], [3,2 / 1,1]
After that, we add the first two balls to the first box and the second two balls to the second box.
We can see that 8 of these 12 possible random distributions have the same number of distinct colors of balls in each box.
Probability is 8/12 = 0.66667

Example 3:

Input: balls = [1,2,1,2]
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: The set of balls is [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]. It is hard to display all the 180 possible random shuffles of this set but it is easy to check that 108 of them will have the same number of distinct colors in each box.
Probability = 108 / 180 = 0.6

Constraints:

1 <= balls.length <= 8
1 <= balls[i] <= 6
